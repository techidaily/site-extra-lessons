In case you are using Premiere Pro and thinking of using the crossfade audio transition, you will have three options, such as –

● Constant power

● Constant gain

● Exponential fade

All these three options are leading to different effects. Now, it depends on the track and its nature and how it does it work on the video and audience. You should choose one option carefully. In case you want to add a quick effect of fade out and in, you should consider constant gain. The use of constant power will allow you to get a transition between both tracks without any gap or space lack. For slow fade out and in effects, you can go with the option of exponential fade. All these options will help you work out properly and make things much easier.
