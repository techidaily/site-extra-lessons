## Part 1: How to Speed Up Videos on Snapchat?

In Snapchat, **the process of how do you speed up a video on Snapchat** depends on the filters available. The Speed Modifier filter options have high-quality speed-changing functions, including the Speed Up option. This filter improves the recorded video speed when you apply it, and even the audio pitch changes accordingly.

Specifically, the speed-up feature appears with a hare (jumping or sprinting) icon and a fast-forward icon. Remember that you can use this filter type on recorded Snapchat videos only and not while recording.

**A step-by-step breakdown of how to speed up Snapchat videos:**

Step1 Download the Snapchat app and launch it on your iPhone or Android smartphone. Sign into the app using your credentials.

Step2 Tap and hold your finger on the Capture button. This will record the video. Keep your hold on the button until the recording is complete, and then release it.

Step3 On your screen, swipe in the right direction until you see the Rabbit icon. In the matter of **how to speed up a video on snap,** this is the one that represents speed increase motion.

Step4 See the preview of the video you clicked at a higher speed. If satisfied, click on the Save button or Next to share it with other contacts.

Step2 Hold your finger down on the Record button to record your video. Then, release it if you are done and the video will develop. You can add other editing elements like text, stickers, etc.
