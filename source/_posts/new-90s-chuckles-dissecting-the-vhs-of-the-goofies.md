## Part 2: How Was VHS Technology Used in Old Movies?

VHS technology played a significant role in producing and viewing movies during its prime era. Before you apply **Goofy movie VHS effects** to your video, learn how they were used. Here are some ways this technology was used in old movies:

**1\. Home Video Market**

VHS has revolutionized the home video market by introducing the concept of renting movies. People used to either rent or own movies on videocassettes. It allowed them to watch movies conveniently without relying on theatrical screenings. Movie studios and distributors started releasing films on VHS tapes, which could be rented from stores.

This technology also facilitated the preservation and archiving of movies. Film studios, libraries, and institutions started transferring movies from reels to VHS tapes. It allowed for easier storage, duplication, and accessibility of movies. Additionally, it is a more manageable way to store the archives and a widely compatible format.

**3\. Film Distribution**

These tapes became a popular format for distributing movies to rental stores and retail outlets. Film distributors would duplicate and distribute movies on VHS tapes. Then, these VHS tapes are sold or rented to customers. This widespread distribution contributed to the availability of movies for home viewing.

It further allows them to self-distribute or sell their films directly to audiences. Furthermore, these tapes can reach a wider audience and establish the careers of many filmmakers.

**5\. Special Editions and Bonus Features**

As the VHS market grew, movie distributors released special editions and collector's versions. These releases often included bonus features like behind-the-scenes footage and more. It also included interviews, the making of the movie, and deleted scenes. Similarly, people can experience additional content beyond the theatrical release.
