Step 1: Reveal Markup Toolbar

Step 2: Use the Shapes Tool

Next, click the **Border Color** and **Fill Color** icons and select your preferred colors for the shape’s outline and background color.

Step 3: Use the Text Tool

Click the **Text** tool from the **Markup Toolbar**, drag the text frame to your preferred location on the image, and use the scaling handles to resize the frame.
