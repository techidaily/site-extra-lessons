The coolest thing about Windows 11 that most people don’t know is the ‘Voice Typing’ feature. You might have experienced this before in your iPhones or Android devices, but this is new for Windows to have voice typing built-in. Press ‘Windows Key + H’ when you are in a text box and then start speaking. By using the mic button from the pop-out menu, you can start using the feature.

### 7\. Widgets and Chat Customization

Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.

However, some people do not like using this kind of stuff. They don’t even prefer crowding their taskbar. For such cases, you can turn them off from the toggle switches that are available in the ‘Show or Hide the buttons that appear on Taskbar' or 'Taskbar Items. '

Another brilliant Windows 11 tip and trick is that it lets you block the pop-ups and also the tracking. For that, open Microsoft Edge and head over to the 3 dots on the top right corner to open 'Settings.' From the left panel in Settings, look for 'Privacy, Search and Services.' By default, it is set to 'Balanced.' You are suggested to select the 'Strict' option so that all the harmful trackers are blocked.

### 9\. Change your Geolocation

Every app we install has our location, but with Windows 11, we can change our default location. For this fun tip, press 'Win + I' to open the 'Settings.' Then head over to the ‘Privacy & Security’ section. Now, scroll down and look for the 'Location' tab.

For changing your default location, hit the ‘Set Default’ button on the right side of the screen. This will open the Map. Now, enter the location that you want to have, and lastly, click on the ‘Change’ button in the top left corner.
