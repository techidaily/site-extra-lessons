## Part 3\. Edit Photos and Add Date Stamps On The Computer

Mac and windows have free image editing programs that allow you to copy an image from its source, paste it into the editor, crop it, resize it, and then save it. First, let's look at how to **edit a photo on a Mac.**

### Use the inbuilt photo on Mac to edit the photo

Drag and drop your image onto the app window after launching the built-in Images app from your dock or **Finder > Applications** to begin editing photos on your Mac.

You can perform simple tweaking after the image is in the editor to help make your images stand out. Let's examine some of the most popular photo-editing tools you will probably use.

##### Step1Straighten, flip, rotate, and crop

First, to resize an image in the Photos app on a Mac, enter editing mode by clicking the Edit button located at the top right corner of the Photos app window. Next, select an option by dragging the edges of the cropping framework that shows on your image in the Crop tab, which is in the middle of your Photos window.
