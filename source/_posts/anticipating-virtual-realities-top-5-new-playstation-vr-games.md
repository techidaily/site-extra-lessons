## 1\. [Batman Arkham VR]( https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/batman-arkham-vr-ps4/ )

 In this game the player immerses into the Universe of the Dark Knights. They will be experiencing the Gotham City through the eyes of one of the greatest detectives. The players would have to think like Batman does and uses his gadgets that are almost legendary to our eyes. They have to unravel whatever the plot in store for them.

 The players can grab for gadgets that are for detective scanning. By pointing it to an object they can look for additional clues. For crime scenes, they would need to point it at moments that are precise in order to scan points that are important then a profile should be compiled.

 The player can also pull things close through the bat claw. There are also certain areas where this can be used for the Batwing to be latched and leave that area. They could also disable circuits and activate switches through Batarang.

 There are three acts of Batman Story:

* Playing Dress-up is the first act where you change to your costume then explores a crime scene with your gadget and see some terrible things happening to your loved ones.
* On the act II you will be the greatest detective in the world and start investigating everything.
* On the last part, you will make sense of them all. After all you are Batman.
