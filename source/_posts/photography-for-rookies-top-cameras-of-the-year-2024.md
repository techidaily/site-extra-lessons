What is the [best camera for beginners](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to use? Can you find the best entry level camera without spending a lot of money on it?

In this article, we are going to share what you need to look for in a great camera. Plus, we’re going to help you look at the different digital cameras for beginners so that you can find one that is right for you and your needs.

## Part 1: How Do I Choose a Camera

There are hundreds of cameras available to choose from. How do you know which one is going to be right for your purposes? Here’s a quick look at some of the most important traits that you’ll want to keep an eye out for during your search.

* **Portability**: If you want to make sure that you can take your camera with you everywhere, then a simple point and click option may be perfect for what you’re looking for. While these typically have a fixed lens, the technology for these cameras have gotten a lot better at providing flexibility and excellent results, as well. In many cases, beginners benefit from using a simple [point-and-click camera](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/best-point-and-shoot-cameras/) at first.
* **Budget**: You always want to be sure that you look at price when you’re looking at beginner cameras. More often than not, you’re going to want to get something that is relatively affordable without sacrificing quality. You may not know whether or not you want to pursue this whole picture and video hobby, and a cheaper camera will make it easier to sell if you find it’s not for you.
* **Lenses**: If you’re someone that is looking to step into something a little more complicated, you may also want the flexibility to [switch out the lenses](https://lifehacker.com/the-fastest-way-to-change-lenses-on-your-dslr-1191321251) that you’re using. Point and click cameras typically don’t have this capability, but you can still find some reasonably affordable options that allow for you to switch lenses in and out.

## Camera Options for Beginners

### 1\. [Nikon D3500](https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D3500-NIKKOR-18-55mm-3-5-5-6G/dp/B07GWKDLGT/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?keywords=Nikon+D3500&qid=1583896637&sr=8-3)

**Cons:** Some users complain of battery drain. People with more experience may be concerned with the fact that you can’t do bracketed shoots with a delay. The unit also overheats on occasion.

### 3\. [EOS Rebel T7](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Rebel-T7-18-55mm-II/dp/B07C2Z21X5/ref=sr%5F1%5F8?crid=31NIXUNMDSPQR&keywords=canon+eos+rebel+t7&qid=1583897245&sprefix=Canon+EOS+Rebel+T%2Caps%2C478&sr=8-8)

### 4\. [Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II Mirrorless Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Mirrorless-Camera-14-42mm-Silver/dp/B01CIXJSOK/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?crid=1P1YSTDMUHBWL&keywords=olympus+om-d+e-m10+mark+iii&qid=1583897552&sprefix=Olympus+OM-D+E-M10+Mark+II%2Caps%2C461&sr=8-5)

**Pros:** If you’re using this camera, it has a low upfront cost to it.

Both pictures and videos look crisp and smooth, and you’ll get high-quality results every time you use it.

**Cons:** The battery life isn’t the greatest; most users recommend that you get an extra battery (which are reasonably affordable). The camera isn’t huge, and moving targets may get blurry, even with the autofocus. Some people find the navigation screen confusing; others do not.

### 5\. [Fujifilm X-T10 Silver Mirrorless Digital Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-X-T10-Silver-Mirrorless-OIS/dp/B00X7QTVSQ/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?keywords=Fujifilm+X-T100&qid=1583897746&sr=8-3)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. Is Canon or Nikon better for beginners?

In all honesty, it depends on what you’re looking for. Similar models are similarly priced, which makes a choice all the more difficult. Both Canon and Nikon make beginner level cameras – the T7i and the D5600, respectively.

The T7i has a better sensor and ends up being much lighter than the Canon model. But, on the other hand, the shooting FPS and the number of autofocus points are better on the [Nikon D5600](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d5600.html). So, if you have some preferences related to what you’re shooting or how you want to shoot it, you’ll want to choose one over the other.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. Is Canon or Nikon better for beginners?

In all honesty, it depends on what you’re looking for. Similar models are similarly priced, which makes a choice all the more difficult. Both Canon and Nikon make beginner level cameras – the T7i and the D5600, respectively.

The T7i has a better sensor and ends up being much lighter than the Canon model. But, on the other hand, the shooting FPS and the number of autofocus points are better on the [Nikon D5600](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d5600.html). So, if you have some preferences related to what you’re shooting or how you want to shoot it, you’ll want to choose one over the other.
