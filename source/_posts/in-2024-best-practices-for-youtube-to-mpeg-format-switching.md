### 1\. Is MPEG 4 the same as MP4? Which is better?

MPEG 4 is a type of overall term developed under the Moving Pictures Experts Group that includes multiple media containers. Therefore, it is suitable for sharing multiple video-based contents across the internet. In comparison, MP4 is one of the media containers under this broad umbrella, which focuses on file compression, e.g., videos/images.

MPEG4 does not use up bandwidth must and holds high compression, which makes it a suitable choice for many media players.

### 2\. Is MPEG YouTube's Preferred Video Format?

The preferred video format for YouTube is mainly MPEG-2 type, with Dolby AC-3 video or MPEG Layer 11 video codecs. Alternatively, one can **download YouTube video MPEG** 4 formatted types.

Other formats that the streaming platform mainly supports include FLV, MP4, MOV, WMV, AVI, 3GPP, MPGEGPS, and WebM. However, for best results, **download YouTube videos in MPEG** format only.
