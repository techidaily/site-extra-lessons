#### **Video and Photo Quality:**

 Video and photo quality of Drift Ghost S is good enough as compared to other competing devices in the same price range.

If you start recording at 960p then frame rate can be adjusted to 48fps whereas if you need to slow down videos then it is good to switch to 720p. With 960p and 720p the FOV limits to 160 degrees. The video compression level can be also adjusted with ease by choosing high bit rates or normal mode.

 It is possible to record footage with Ghost S in high bit rate as well as in normal mode. The still quality is 12MP that offers crystal clear views. When you use normal bit rate at 1080p then edges of videos appear jagged and interlaced. But this issue can be slightly resolved with high bit rate settings.
