## Part 1: What is Google Photos?

Google Photos is a platform for uploading, sharing, and storing digital photos. A year after its debut, it's already a global phenomenon. And Google Photographs uses the term "the cloud" to refer to the online storage of your photos and videos.

If you had to do this in the past, you would have had to connect your phone or camera to a computer to upload your photographs and movies. You may have then backed up your PC to an external hard drive. But now, with Google Photos, the process is effortless and does not require a USB connection.

In addition to the benefits listed above, keeping your photographs and movies in the cloud has the following aspects:

* It has many options for organizing, using, sharing, and managing your photographs and videos.
* It's compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
* Anyone can use Google Photos, regardless of their level of computer literacy. It's easy to figure out where you are and how to go about.
* The days of running out of space on your phone are long gone. You'll be able to free up some space on your phone once you've uploaded your pictures and movies.
* As long as you have an internet connection, you may view your photographs and videos from any device (phone, tablet, computer).
* To share an album of images or videos with a friend or family member is easy.
* Whenever you're connected to Wi-Fi, you may schedule automatic backups to take place.
* Storage space is provided at no cost to you. If you want your images to be preserved at their original resolution, you can pay, but you'll probably be happy with the free version's typical excellent quality. Compression is applied to images and movies with a resolution of more than 16MP. More on storage will be covered later.

## Part 2: How to Get Started with Google Photos?

After you’ve installed the app on your smartphone, it’s time to get started with exploring the interface and the various editing options it contains.

**Step** **1**: Launch the app and **Sign In To Your Google Account.** There is a good chance that you already have a Google account (such as Gmail). If you haven't already, it's fast and simple to join up.

**Step** **2**: Once you've logged in, all you have to do is **follow the on-screen instructions** to begin uploading your photographs and videos.

**Note**: If you have many photographs and videos, this may take some time. If you don't want to waste your mobile data, make sure you're connected to the internet through Wi-Fi.

**_Photos, Search, Sharing_**, and **_Library_** are the three primary tabs at the bottom of the Google Photos program. If you're using an iPhone/iPad or an Android device, you'll notice the app has a slightly different design. Let's look into this in more depth:

**1\. The Photos Tab**

## Part 1: What is Google Photos?

Google Photos is a platform for uploading, sharing, and storing digital photos. A year after its debut, it's already a global phenomenon. And Google Photographs uses the term "the cloud" to refer to the online storage of your photos and videos.

If you had to do this in the past, you would have had to connect your phone or camera to a computer to upload your photographs and movies. You may have then backed up your PC to an external hard drive. But now, with Google Photos, the process is effortless and does not require a USB connection.

In addition to the benefits listed above, keeping your photographs and movies in the cloud has the following aspects:

* It has many options for organizing, using, sharing, and managing your photographs and videos.
* It's compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
* Anyone can use Google Photos, regardless of their level of computer literacy. It's easy to figure out where you are and how to go about.
* The days of running out of space on your phone are long gone. You'll be able to free up some space on your phone once you've uploaded your pictures and movies.
* As long as you have an internet connection, you may view your photographs and videos from any device (phone, tablet, computer).
* To share an album of images or videos with a friend or family member is easy.
* Whenever you're connected to Wi-Fi, you may schedule automatic backups to take place.
* Storage space is provided at no cost to you. If you want your images to be preserved at their original resolution, you can pay, but you'll probably be happy with the free version's typical excellent quality. Compression is applied to images and movies with a resolution of more than 16MP. More on storage will be covered later.

**Step** **2**: Once you've logged in, all you have to do is **follow the on-screen instructions** to begin uploading your photographs and videos.

**Note**: If you have many photographs and videos, this may take some time. If you don't want to waste your mobile data, make sure you're connected to the internet through Wi-Fi.

**_Photos, Search, Sharing_**, and **_Library_** are the three primary tabs at the bottom of the Google Photos program. If you're using an iPhone/iPad or an Android device, you'll notice the app has a slightly different design. Let's look into this in more depth:

## Part 4: How to Create Videos With Google Photos?

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need a Google-enabled Android phone or tablet to use Google Photos. Using Google Photos on a mobile device requires some fiddling if it doesn't support the service. Google images may be used to create movies on Android smartphones by following these instructions.

**Step 1:** To use the app, you first need to sign up for an account. To begin, you'll need to **Sign In** using your Gmail Account if you've previously enrolled.

**Step 2**: Select **Library** from the drop-down menu in the lower right corner of your mobile device's display. Scroll down to **Utilities** and click on it. **Animation**, **Collage,** and **Movie** are all included in the **Create New** section. As this instruction is about making a movie, the **Movie** button will be selected.

![create videos google photos library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-videos-google-photos-library.jpg)

**Step 3:** Choosing a movie theme on the "Create Movie" tab or creating a new standard movie is the only option.

![create movie google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-movie-google-photos.jpg)

**Step 4**: When making a video, now you may choose from up to 50 images and clips. Once you've chosen your material, just hit the "create" button, and Google will arrange your images and videos in chronological order for you.
