### 01[**Collage Maker**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instacollage-pro-pic-frame/id530957474)

The first app on this list that you can use to create a collage on your iPhone device is ‘Collage Maker’ This is a great collage app for those who want a lot of variety in their collages. After all, the layouts are endless (especially since they are customizable (only increasing the number of true layout options) The app also comes with a photo editor. So, if you’re the kind that likes to edit while working, then this is a good one to pick out.

### 04**Layout from Instagram**

‘Layout from Instagram’ is the stand-alone version of ‘Layout’ Mode (which you can access on Insta Story) Like the previous app, this is the one to pick if what you’re intending is to stand out from the crowd on social media. Although, of course, if that’s not your thing, you can simply enjoy the app for its ability to help you create a collage on your iPhone

![Layout — Collage App iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-collage-on-iphone-handy-tips15.png)

Pic Stich, while not the most popular collage app on iPhone, is quite a great resource regardless.

And, it also comes with both a photo and video editor that you can use to polish up all your collages.

### 07**Frames**

Frames, in the end, is quite similar to Collage Maker (making the two interchangeable).

Photo Collage Maker & Pic Grid is another version of the app that we introduced at the top of this list.

Though you might want to try both of them out regardless.

## Part 1 **Tips for Making a Photo Collage on Your iPhone**

For general collage-making tips to help ease your way, we’ve included this first section for the best practices It’s short and it introduces fairly simple techniques, but it will save you some time in the future if you intend on creating a lot of collages. So, we recommend at least skimming through it.

### 01**Prepare Your Photographs**

In order to make it easier to **make a collage on iPhone** you’ll need to prep your photographs beforehand. Trust us on this A lot of apps don’t have a ‘Search’ function that you can use and scrolling through all your photos can be a pain (as it will not only result in mis-clicked photos but also, you might completely miss out on the images that you actually want to use for your **iPhone photo collage**.)

So, basically? Make sure to get them prepped beforehand And, if possible, keep them at the top of your images list or in an album so that they are easy to find.

### 02**Prepare an Aesthetic**

If you’re planning to print this collage out or just share it with your friends and family, then perhaps this step is not necessary. But, even then, if you want to impress, you might want to **make a collage on iPhone** with a set theme, you know? For example, choosing photographs that have the same effect on them or have repeating colors (i.e., pink-hued images with pink-hued images.) Doing this will make your resulting **iPhone photo collage** look much more cohesive in the end

### 03**Consider Placements Carefully**

Depending on what effect you’re looking for, the placing of all the photos in your **iPhone photo collage** is very important. Look at the sample image that we’ve attached Here, the letter ‘A’ stands out quite a lot and may make it harder to see the rest of the photos. But it also has the benefit of drawing the attention of the viewer again and again with how vibrant it is (and thus, it makes the rest of the photographs more likely to be seen than if it was just similar objects all placed together.)

### 01[**Collage Maker**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instacollage-pro-pic-frame/id530957474)

The first app on this list that you can use to create a collage on your iPhone device is ‘Collage Maker’ This is a great collage app for those who want a lot of variety in their collages.

PicCollage is another popular collage app that comes with lots of fun and quirky layouts that you probably won’t see anywhere else.

### 06**Pic Stitch**

Pic Stich, while not the most popular collage app on iPhone, is quite a great resource regardless. Like most of the ones we’ve introduced so far, it has a good selection of collage layouts (both the basic ones and the quirkier ones).

### 07**Frames**

Frames, in the end, is quite similar to Collage Maker (making the two interchangeable). This app was also primarily set up for iPad but it’s also available for iPhones The best part about it is the large selection of layouts — which only increase in size because of their customizability (which allows you to control layout borders and background.)

### 08**Photo Collage Maker ＆ Pic Grid**

Photo Collage Maker & Pic Grid is another version of the app that we introduced at the top of this list. It offers slightly different functions and features, but the two are interchangeable, so you don’t necessarily have to worry about picking between the two. Though you might want to try both of them out regardless.

### 09**Pic Party**

Pic Party has a lot of fun, free-style collage layouts that allow you to really step up your collage game. It does also mean that you’ll need to exercise your creativity some more though. So, if you’re not prepared for that, you might prefer to go for one of the simpler options we introduced in the beginning.

### 01**Prepare Your Photographs**

In order to make it easier to **make a collage on iPhone** you’ll need to prep your photographs beforehand. Trust us on this A lot of apps don’t have a ‘Search’ function that you can use and scrolling through all your photos can be a pain (as it will not only result in mis-clicked photos but also, you might completely miss out on the images that you actually want to use for your **iPhone photo collage**.)

So, basically? Make sure to get them prepped beforehand And, if possible, keep them at the top of your images list or in an album so that they are easy to find.

![Prepare Images for iPhone Photo Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-collage-on-iphone-handy-tips1.png)

### 02**Prepare an Aesthetic**

If you’re planning to print this collage out or just share it with your friends and family, then perhaps this step is not necessary. But, even then, if you want to impress, you might want to **make a collage on iPhone** with a set theme, you know? For example, choosing photographs that have the same effect on them or have repeating colors (i.e., pink-hued images with pink-hued images.) Doing this will make your resulting **iPhone photo collage** look much more cohesive in the end

### 03**Consider Placements Carefully**

Depending on what effect you’re looking for, the placing of all the photos in your **iPhone photo collage** is very important. Look at the sample image that we’ve attached Here, the letter ‘A’ stands out quite a lot and may make it harder to see the rest of the photos. But it also has the benefit of drawing the attention of the viewer again and again with how vibrant it is (and thus, it makes the rest of the photographs more likely to be seen than if it was just similar objects all placed together.)

‘Layout from Instagram’ is the stand-alone version of ‘Layout’ Mode (which you can access on Insta Story) Like the previous app, this is the one to pick if what you’re intending is to stand out from the crowd on social media. Although, of course, if that’s not your thing, you can simply enjoy the app for its ability to help you create a collage on your iPhone

### 05**PicCollage**

PicCollage is another popular collage app that comes with lots of fun and quirky layouts that you probably won’t see anywhere else. To add to this, it also comes with ‘freestyle editing tools’ that you can use in order to make sure that your pictures look perfect before and after you’ve included them in your **iPhone photo collage**.

### 06**Pic Stitch**

Pic Stich, while not the most popular collage app on iPhone, is quite a great resource regardless. Like most of the ones we’ve introduced so far, it has a good selection of collage layouts (both the basic ones and the quirkier ones). And, it also comes with both a photo and video editor that you can use to polish up all your collages.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 07**Frames**

Frames, in the end, is quite similar to Collage Maker (making the two interchangeable). This app was also primarily set up for iPad but it’s also available for iPhones The best part about it is the large selection of layouts — which only increase in size because of their customizability (which allows you to control layout borders and background.)

### 08**Photo Collage Maker ＆ Pic Grid**

Photo Collage Maker & Pic Grid is another version of the app that we introduced at the top of this list. It offers slightly different functions and features, but the two are interchangeable, so you don’t necessarily have to worry about picking between the two. Though you might want to try both of them out regardless.

### 09**Pic Party**

Pic Party has a lot of fun, free-style collage layouts that allow you to really step up your collage game. It does also mean that you’ll need to exercise your creativity some more though. So, if you’re not prepared for that, you might prefer to go for one of the simpler options we introduced in the beginning.

### 10**Photo Collage Maker: Pic Grid**

Photo Collage Maker, but specifically the ‘Pic Grid’ version This one has a very quirky selection of layouts that you can use. And is quite popular for those who are on social media a lot. It’s designed primarily for iPad, but it will work for iPhone as well with no issues.
