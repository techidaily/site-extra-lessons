## What are Video Effects?

The acronym VFX stands for video effects. The term "visual effects," also known as "VFX," refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.

### How does VFX differ from SFX?

These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.

Usually, you can infer from the context which "kind" of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.

Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story's narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?

### When to use SFX

Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.

### When to use VFX

Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?

It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.

Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not "behave" the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be "ordered" to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.

Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren't always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.

Video effects are easy to find. After all, it all depends on your situation, whether you have the resources to get a premium video effect or save your money and stick to the free ones. Being a successful video editor is not based on how much money you spend on your work or how premium the video effects you use. It depends on your strategy, how you utilize all your resources and deliver the story perfectly to the audience, and how you want it to be. I hope this article contributes to your knowledge of getting free video effects.
