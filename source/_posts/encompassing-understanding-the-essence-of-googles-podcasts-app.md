Now that you know **what the Google Podcast app is,** you can also use it to post your show content. However, one cannot use this app to create new shows; one can only add the RSS feed of the show's URL to the platform.

### Best Features for Podcast Recording/Editing with Filmora

* 1000+ royalty-free songs & audio effects in the backdrop.
* Making podcasts more accessible with Speech to Text (STT).
