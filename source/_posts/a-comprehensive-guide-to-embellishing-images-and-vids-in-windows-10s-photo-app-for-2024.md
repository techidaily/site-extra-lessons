The Photos app in Windows 10 is even easier than the old Windows Movie Maker. You do not need a sharp learning curve for using this app and any beginner can use it with ease and comfort. The Photos app has an anchoring system along with the text tool that makes the text move with the video images. Here’s how you can make the text move in Windows 10 Photos app-

* On the right, find the effects sidebar and select any effect that you find suitable for your video text
