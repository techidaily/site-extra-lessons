## Part 4 What Music Use On iMovie

How To Add Spotify Music To IMovie

For those of you wondering, can you add Spotify music to iMovie? The answer is yes. It's relatively simple to add Spotify music to iMovie. First, you need to move tracks from Spotify to the Music app on your phone.

● On an open project, tap the 'Add Media' button.

● Select 'Audio'. This gives you two options. One, you can tap on 'Music' to grab tracks from Spotify.

● You can also choose 'My Music' to look for songs backed up on iCloud or other storage locations.

● Simply tap the plus button next to the track you've selected to add the songs to the timeline.

With that, you should have no more questions on how to put Spotify music on iMovie. Also, beware of DRM-protected audio files. You might not be able to use those files.
