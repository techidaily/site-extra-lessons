 If you are looking for 4K package drones under $500 the UPair One can be bought from $250 depending on whether you want the 2K or 4K camera. It has been compared to GoPro quality and has been around since the end of 2015\. It was created as one of the affordable drone's alternatives to the DJI Phantom 3 which means you will be able to get the majority of the features for less. Everything except for the propellers is already set up so it's simple to set up and go. Even the camera and gimbal have been mounted to make it easier. The GPS system can return home quickly with only 10 feet between its landing and the original take off location. There's no need to recalibrate as it does it automatically while in flight and is able to fly up to 1000 meters from the operator.

* FPV system range: up to 600 meters
* 2K or 4K Camera
* Varied field of view
* 7 inch monitor
* Camera recording status
* Failsafe programing to stop the battery dying so that the drone automatically returns
* 5400mAh Smart Battery
* 11-15 minutes runtime with gimball and camera, 25 minutes without
