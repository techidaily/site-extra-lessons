## Part 1: How Can You Edit Photo Background Better?

Want to achieve the perfect photo editing background technique? What better way to do that than Photoshop?

[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) by Adobe is a premium-level image and graphics editor. Photoshop has held the gold standard for editing graphics and images for years. It is undoubtedly the best photo background editor app you can find to get your job done. With its precise tools and a sleek interface, it is relatively easy to insert your photo and edit background image.

Here is how you can edit and replace your image background in Photoshop:

Step 1: Select your Subject

Add your image to the interface of the program. From the toolbar on the left, tap the “Quick Selection” tool. Now drag the area of the image you want to select using the brush. You can hold the “Alt” key and drag the unwanted areas to remove them from the selection.

Step 2: Mask your Selection

Go to the options bar present at the top. Tap on “Select and Mask” to convert your selection into a mask. From the “Properties” panel, tap “View Mode” to determine how you want to see your selection. “Overlay” works best in general.

Step 3: Polish the Edges

You can now further refine your selected part using the different tools offered by Photoshop. Use the “Quick Selection” tool to add or remove large areas.
