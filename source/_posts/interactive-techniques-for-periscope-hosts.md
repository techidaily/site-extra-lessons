#### Selfie Stick

 For Periscope live streaming, you can undoubtedly go for a selfie stick, as it can solve your numerous shooting woes. Imagine you are broadcasting a live interview and the crowd around you makes it impossible to prevent the shaky shots. A selfie stick stabilizes the mobile camera and helps you capture a flawless video at high angle.

#### Interact with your audience

 To have the best Periscope live video streaming experience, you need to be very interactive with your audience. When you win their attention, they bring in more viewers by word of mouth. When they get the opportunity to take part in your broadcasts by commenting, asking questions, being answered, it positively impacts your purpose.

 There are ways to gain their confidence; either by a Q & A session after the broadcast or a live chat window alongside your broadcast to engage the audience. Create the curiosity to let them come back for the next live video streaming.
