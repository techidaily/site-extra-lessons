## Crafting a Compelling Narrative: A Key to More Viewers and Subscribers

As a content creator the first struggle to create a YouTube channel is on how to grow your subscriber. You can get YouTube subscriber by creating a video. This is also the hardest part of monetizing a channel. Unless the content is deeply satisfying, viewers watch dozens of videos without ever hitting subscriber. That's why earning 4,000 watch hours could be easier than gaining YouTube subscriber.

YouTube channel become eligible for the YouTube partner program, which allows creator to monetize their videos with ads, plus reaching the other requirement of 4,000 hours of watch time and 1000 subscriber makes getting into YPP super easy. Monitizing your channel is a way to pay your video creation but before you will be monetized you need to reach YouTube requirements and one of this is to have a 1000 subscriber. But how you will get these thousand subscribers if you are a beginner.

To help you grow your YouTube subscriber here's my tips that will help you retain attention on the video platform.

## Tips on How to Grow YouTube Subscriber

### Quality Content

Identify which videos attract the most subscribers if you have 20 or more videos on your channel, why not see which ones attracted the most subscriber.

The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. How to do it? Plan every video you want and always do research. Watch your competitors' videos and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather than copying what your competition is doing, find a more a creative way to do it better. For example, I choose skin care review, before doing it I do research on how other creator do this kind of content for me to have an idea on how i deliver the information to my viewers. I make sure that i made my video different from others, straight to the point and always with the result of the product.

### YouTube Collab To Other Content Creator

Because collaboration benefits everyone, working with influencer is a great way to get in front of potential subscriber to your channel. Try to reach out to similar users in your field and ask them out for an opportunity to work together on something interesting. Creator put a lot of work into video collaborations. They search for likeminded partners, brainstorm collab ideas, and film several videos together. But after all that work, the two creators get a priceless reward sharing their audiences. Doing research who to work with before deciding to collab some content creator will help you match with partners where you have a higher chance of gaining interested and engaged followers. Video collabs are a vital way to get YouTube subscribers, no matter the size of your channel

### YouTube Keywords, thumbnail and video Titles

YouTube keywords are the foundations of any great channel, and they're the best way to get traffic as a new creator. Adding relevant terms to your tittles and video description will help your content climb search result fast. Don't make the tittle too long and make your title be descriptive as to give your audience a sneak peek as to what the video all about. Create a custom human thumbnail because your video thumbnails are essentially the cover of your video, so you need it to be absolutely beyond engaging. Using annotations and relevant images as custom thumbnail for your YouTube videos will increases your videos click through rate. Thumbnail help you attract new users to your channel and if you are not designing catchy thumbnail you are missing out a lot.

### Produce a High-Quality Video

Pay attention particularly to the lightning, audio and editing of your videos. These days there's no need to drop and amount of money to buy an expensive camera as long as you have your smart phone or whatever cameras you have that you will used to shoot a video. When you have thought of good content next step is how to enhance the video, so you must need to learn on how to make your video editing catchy.
