## Part 1: What Is a Steadicam and Why Should You Use it?

A Steadicam is equipment that moves smoothly to create stable video footage. It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator's body at chest level, known as "the shoulder mount." The armature fits over one of the operator's shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.

They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.

Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to "fly" through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.

The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there's no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.

## Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?

Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.

**The Classic Steadicam:** This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today. It has a two-point support system, which gives it more stability but decreases mobility slightly.

**The Merlin:** This was designed as a more portable version of the classic Steadicam and used a three-point support system for better stability.

**The Ultra:** This is the most recent addition to Steadicams and has a two-point support system, which makes it easy to set up and use quickly but decreases stability slightly.

The Steadicam consists of three main parts: the Steadicam arm, the sled, and the vest.

First, attach the Steadicam arm to the tripod socket on the sled's bottom. Next, adjust the arm's length so that it is in line with your shoulder. Tighten the knob on top of the arm to secure it in place.

Next, fit the vest around your waist and tighten both straps evenly. Now you can attach the sled to your vest. You should be able to feel a little weight on your shoulders and chest, but not too much.

Finally, connect the arm and vest with all its links (the black bars). Tighten each link one by one until they are snug against each other.

That's how easy it is to set up a Steadicam!!

* More expensive than other gimbals in the market

**Should you buy it?**

If money is no problem for you, I would say get this one because it offers a higher payload capacity than its competitors.

### 5\. Flycam HD-5000

The Flycam HD-5000 is designed for DSLRs and camcorders weighing up to 11 pounds, making it great for most people who are just starting in this field. It comes with an adjustable handle with an expandable range of 21.6-28.7 inches so that everyone can use it comfortably while moving around or during shoots, regardless of height.

**Features**

The unit features an adjustable push-button, so it's effortless to control your device's movements from front to back and left to right at all times. The stabilizer makes using the system more user-friendly than others on the market.

**Pros**

* Very easy to set up and use right out of the box
* Foldable design for maximum portability and storage
* Push-button controls for easy access and control of your DSLR or camcorder's movements at all times

**Cons**

* Pricey compared to other stabilizer models today, but still has a great value.
* The wheels are not replaceable.

**Should you buy it?**

I would say yes if you're looking to invest in a good stabilizer that will last you a long time and is easy to use. This one has a very high payload capacity compared to other Steadicams out there, so it makes your DSLR or camcorder look great throughout your shoot.

## Part 4: How to Set up a Steadicam?

The Steadicam consists of three main parts: the Steadicam arm, the sled, and the vest.

First, attach the Steadicam arm to the tripod socket on the sled's bottom. Next, adjust the arm's length so that it is in line with your shoulder. Tighten the knob on top of the arm to secure it in place.

Next, fit the vest around your waist and tighten both straps evenly. Now you can attach the sled to your vest. You should be able to feel a little weight on your shoulders and chest, but not too much.

Finally, connect the arm and vest with all its links (the black bars). Tighten each link one by one until they are snug against each other.

That's how easy it is to set up a Steadicam!!

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Video Without a Steadicam After Recording?

If you have recorded the video already and found the footage is shaky, you may need a post-production software to remove the shaky and stabilize the video.

Wondershare Filmora video editor allows you to stabilize the shaky video automatically with a few clicks. Watch the video tutorial below to find the detailed information.

**Conclusion**

The benefits of using a Steadicam are clear, and if you're interested in creating cinematic scenes to enthrall your audience, we highly recommend that you invest in one. You'll be able to capture shots that would otherwise be impossible with handheld or mounted cameras. Plus, it will help reduce the fatigue caused by holding such weight for long periods! We hope this article has given you enough information to make an informed decision about which type is best for your needs.

## Part 1: What Is a Steadicam and Why Should You Use it?

A Steadicam is equipment that moves smoothly to create stable video footage. It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator's body at chest level, known as "the shoulder mount." The armature fits over one of the operator's shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.

They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.

Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to "fly" through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.

The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there's no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.

## Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?

Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.

**The Classic Steadicam:** This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today. It has a two-point support system, which gives it more stability but decreases mobility slightly.

**The Merlin:** This was designed as a more portable version of the classic Steadicam and used a three-point support system for better stability.

**The Ultra:** This is the most recent addition to Steadicams and has a two-point support system, which makes it easy to set up and use quickly but decreases stability slightly.

## Part 3: Best Steadicams for DSRL Filming
