## Access All Shows: Seamless APods Installation Tips

Podcasts are the new 'it' thing many creators are getting into, and audiences focus on for content consumption. Thus, many users **download Apple Podcasts,** given the vast library of content available in its repertoire. The shows cover various topics and subjects, and major businesses and influencers use the platform to promote their audio-based projects.

However, as the name suggests, Apple Podcasts is available to a niche group, i.e., iOS users mainly with Apple IDs. So, how to download the episodes and listen? All are covered here.

## Part 1\. Are Apple Podcasts Free to Download?

One of the first points of concern for users when it comes to **Apple Podcasts how to download** is the cost of the app itself. On that note, it is important to mention that the app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch users is free to access. Lots of different shows are available for cost-less listening.

However, some of the podcasters with shows on Apple Podcasts do offer premium episodes, shows, and channels. People can subscribe to their channels with a specified fee that the creator sets on a monthly or yearly payment schedule.

Users that want to access these premium/bonus episodes, ad-free listening, get faster access to their archives and get a first look at new shows can opt for the subscription. The costs can vary as per the channels, with some offering a 7-day trial and USD 3.99 per month or other offers.

### Issue 4: Bad network connection error

Sometimes, the main cause of the failure to download Apple podcast episodes occurs due to connection issues directly. In this case, users continuously notice problems while trying to download their Podcasts app.

**Fix: Reset the network settings**

You should change your network settings completely to resolve this issue. You will not lose any available data. However, the process involves setting up the Wi-Fi connections fully from the ground-up, so follow the instructions on the screen very carefully.

Go to the Settings menu on your iPhone device and click on the General option. Then, press the Reset option and choose the Reset Network Settings selection.
