## Funny Blur Effects in Picsart

You do not always have to take yourself seriously; sometimes, you only want to create a blur effect for fun. Picsart has a range of funny blur effects that you can apply to your image and have a whale of a time. These effects do not mirror reality but give your picture a cinematic look. Follow the steps above, but when you get to the part where you tap Effects and have selected the Blur options, opt for a different blur filter.

With that in mind, let's look at some funny blur effects in Picsart that you might want to try.

#### Motion Blur

![funny blur effects in picsart - motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-4.png)

As the name suggests, this funny blur effect looks amazing on pictures of vehicles and people in motion. All you have to do is apply the filter, then use the adjustment slider to decrease or increase the intensity of the effect.

When you choose the Motion Blur, this effect automatically colorizes your picture. You can select the color you want by dragging the hue slider; unclick the box located next to the slider to turn the colorization off completely. Your picture will turn back to the original color.

What's more? You can play around with Noise, Angle, and Distance sliders to apply the right amount of motion blur to photos and make sure the sense of movement will go in the right direction.

#### Smart Blur

![funny blur effects in picsart - smart blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-5.png)

Smart Blur gives your photos a luxurious sheen; it blurs out details to make subjects appear less real and a bit more unnaturally perfect. You can consider it a magazine finish.

#### Radial Blur

![funny blur effects in picsart - Radial Blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-6.png)

This blur effect allows you to turn photos into a spinning vortex. It allows you to create a circle of blur effect around a focal point in photos. Every circle has a focal point, and you can move the center of the blur by dragging the crosshairs located in the middle of the blur.

Objects in your image will bend with the curve of the blur; anything lying in the middle of the circling blur will become a greater point of focus. Move the Blur slider located in the effects settings menu to make your image less or more blurry Zero is the minimum, while 20 is the maximum.

You can try to apply the Radial Blur effect to automobiles, trains, and planes to intensify their velocity effect.

#### Focal Blur

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![funny blur effects in picsart - Focal Blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-7.png)

Focal blur is a radial effect that warps the dimensions of your picture a little for an in-motion look. It's perfect for images that have subjects in high-speed settings.

## Conclusion

● Nowadays, the blur effect is a common thing that it's difficult to believe that it used to be regarded as a sign of flawed photography. Photo blurring became widely acknowledged as legit in the late Nineties, and even an aspirational technique called bokeh, a Japanese term that loosely translates as blur quality.

● A quick scan of social media imagery shows how popular it has become over the years. You might have been looking in envy at those dreamy and hazy photos asking yourself: How did the photographer manage this? The answer is Picsart.

● This application has made blurring faces and backgrounds in photos a breeze. That means you can now easily reproduce the blur effect on your photography. The best part is: It is quick and simple to achieve this. Whether you want to hide distracting elements or highlight a figure in the foreground, Picsart can help.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![funny blur effects in picsart - motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-4.png)

As the name suggests, this funny blur effect looks amazing on pictures of vehicles and people in motion. All you have to do is apply the filter, then use the adjustment slider to decrease or increase the intensity of the effect.

When you choose the Motion Blur, this effect automatically colorizes your picture. You can select the color you want by dragging the hue slider; unclick the box located next to the slider to turn the colorization off completely. Your picture will turn back to the original color.

What's more? You can play around with Noise, Angle, and Distance sliders to apply the right amount of motion blur to photos and make sure the sense of movement will go in the right direction.

#### Smart Blur

![funny blur effects in picsart - smart blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-5.png)

Smart Blur gives your photos a luxurious sheen; it blurs out details to make subjects appear less real and a bit more unnaturally perfect. You can consider it a magazine finish.

#### Radial Blur

![funny blur effects in picsart - Radial Blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-6.png)

This blur effect allows you to turn photos into a spinning vortex. It allows you to create a circle of blur effect around a focal point in photos. Every circle has a focal point, and you can move the center of the blur by dragging the crosshairs located in the middle of the blur.

Objects in your image will bend with the curve of the blur; anything lying in the middle of the circling blur will become a greater point of focus. Move the Blur slider located in the effects settings menu to make your image less or more blurry Zero is the minimum, while 20 is the maximum.

You can try to apply the Radial Blur effect to automobiles, trains, and planes to intensify their velocity effect.

#### Focal Blur

![funny blur effects in picsart - Focal Blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-7.png)

Focal blur is a radial effect that warps the dimensions of your picture a little for an in-motion look. It's perfect for images that have subjects in high-speed settings.

## Conclusion

● Nowadays, the blur effect is a common thing that it's difficult to believe that it used to be regarded as a sign of flawed photography. Photo blurring became widely acknowledged as legit in the late Nineties, and even an aspirational technique called bokeh, a Japanese term that loosely translates as blur quality.

● A quick scan of social media imagery shows how popular it has become over the years. You might have been looking in envy at those dreamy and hazy photos asking yourself: How did the photographer manage this? The answer is Picsart.

● This application has made blurring faces and backgrounds in photos a breeze. That means you can now easily reproduce the blur effect on your photography. The best part is: It is quick and simple to achieve this. Whether you want to hide distracting elements or highlight a figure in the foreground, Picsart can help.

Clip art and drawing tools make Picsart far more than a photo application.

Applying a blur effect to images has never been easier with Picsart. This online photo editor features a helpful suite of simple and intuitive editing tools powerful enough to help users produce great images that they can share with their friends and families on social media. Learning how to blur face in Picsart is among the most versatile editing techniques you can use to make eye-catching edits.
