With Photoshop, you can carry out a color correction in 3 simple methods. Read this article and find out a method that will suit you.

First, open Photoshop software. Select “Shape tool” from the left-hand side margin of your interface > “Custom Shapes.” Make a shape based on your preference, i.e., a square. Click and hold the shape tool to create other shapes.

## 3 Simple Methods for Color Correction

With Photoshop, you can carry out a color correction in 3 simple methods. Read this article and find out a method that will suit you.

### Method 1\. Correcting Tones and Colors with Level in Photoshop

The first method we will look at is using levels to color correction in Photoshop. The level is a feature in Photoshop that stretches the brightness levels of footage in a histogram. Besides brightness, levels also play a significant role in regulating contrast and tonal range.

Usually, the output levels are calibrated with marking from 0 to 225, representing black and white, respectively.

Here are the steps on how to color balance using Levels in Photoshop

### Step 2\. Set the Levels to default

Before heading over to correcting colors and tones, you need to make sure that your Photoshop settings are at default.

Click on the “Image menu,” which is at the top of your interface. A drop-down menu will pop. Click on “Adjustments” > “Levels,” and a dialogue box will pop up.

Alternatively, you can use the command prompt “Command+L” in Mac or “CTRL+L” in Windows, and the dialogue box will appear.

There are three eyedroppers on the bottom right corner of your screen. Double-click on the last one on the left, and color picker will appear. Set your RGB to a default of 245 and click “OK” to save the changes. Go back and click on the eyedropper on the furthest right. Set 10 to be its default from the displayed color picker and save it by clicking “OK.”

### Method 3: Using Gradient Tool to Correct Color in Photoshop

The last method of color correcting in Photoshop is using the gradient tool. The gradient tool allows you to create a gradual transition between two or more colors. In Photoshop, the gradient tool is usually represented by the “G” or a rectangular icon.

With the gradient tool, you can edit gradients by choosing different colors, adding more colors, removing colors, and rearranging colors. Furthermore, you can also add transparency and adjust how the colors transition.

Since a gradient needs transitioning from one hue to another, it will always require two or more colors. With a clear understanding of the gradient tools, you can perfectly control the gradient looks and parts of the photo and the specific points affected.

Here are the simple steps to correct color in Photoshop using gradient tools.
