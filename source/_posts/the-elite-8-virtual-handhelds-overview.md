## What is VR controller?

Move controllers provide better controls in VR gaming. Virtual reality is unambiguously better with the use of motion controllers with the hands in VR gaming, that is the reason why the HTC Vive is better in tech than the Oculus Rift right now. It is actually a good thing for the PlayStation VR users, formerly, that Sony 460 VR already featured a motion control platform in their PlayStation Move. So, the use of controllers with VR headsets and other peripherals is giving this technology a new life.
