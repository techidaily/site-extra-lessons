## Legal Tips For Podcast Intro Music

Good podcast intro music does not necessarily mean you have to pay an astronomically high price. On the contrary, you can get music for podcast intros even for free without crediting the musician. However, it is essential to understand how to avoid legal troubles. In other words, understand what is considered legal and illegal or illegitimate use.

Retain that even using non-copyrighted music can sometimes land you in legal trouble, so it is better to know how to avoid it when using non-copyrighted or copyrighted music. Here are the factors that you should always consider when choosing to include any piece in your podcast:

* **Always get permission in writing and transfer or license.** Even when you are using royalty-free music for podcast intros, ensure to have some written proof that you've received permission to use the track in your podcast.
* **Ensure that the transfer license or written permission covers the publisher and creators' names to avoid legal troubles.** Usually, royalty-free music providers bundle all these details together, so you are fine. Still, ensure that the transfer license includes this information.
* **If your podcast plays worldwide, you will need permission from the authors to use the music in all countries.** Otherwise, the use of music can be subjected to perpetuity. That is, you might have permission to use the music tracks in some parts of the world but not the entire world. So, ensure to take permission to use the music track worldwide.
* **Don't use a music track multiple times, even if you have received permission to use it only once.** These distinctions are crucial to specify.
* **Remember the terms and conditions mentioned on the royalty-free music distribution services.** For instance, some Creative Commons licenses come with the situation that you must credit the creator. In case you violate the rule, the music will be considered copyrighted.
* **When you take music from a freelancer, or it is personally made for your podcast on a special request by you, ensure that the creator owns all the rights.** In several cases, podcast creators have had to pay for the freelancer's mistakes. You can sign a contract with the freelancer and ensure that it is composed initially, not copied from some other music.

## Typical Music for Podcast Intro Questions, Answered

No. It will violate copyright laws, and your podcast might be under scrutiny for copyright infringement. Just retain that even a second of copyrighted music can get your podcast banned, or you may get fined by the creator. When using music in professional environments, it is better to avoid copyrighted music created by professionals.

So, avoiding using copyrighted music in your podcasts is best.

### 3\. Can I use their music if my podcast is about reviewing songs or artists?

Yes. If your podcast revolves around criticism, education, media, reporting, or researching, then using copyrighted materials comes into "fair use" practice. Nevertheless, it is better to ask permission from the creators beforehand, as judicial scrutiny can be against your favor.

There are four cycles in which copyrighted music will be evaluated as fair use. They are:

* The character and purpose of use of the copyrighted music.
* The nature of copyrighted music and your work.
* The amount and substantiality of the portion taken, i.e., whether it is genuine or not.
* The effect of using copyrighted music in the potential market.

Judges will evaluate the use of music based on these four principles step-by-step. If the use of copyright passes each step, it will be considered fair use. Otherwise, the use of music will be regarded as illegal, and you may get fined or imprisoned.
