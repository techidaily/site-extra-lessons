 Syma H5C camera is rated as moderately stable and it is capable enough to take impressive pictures from air. This device is equipped with a 2GB MicroSD card that offers personal storage space to all recorded videos and images. The sad part is here that controller unit of this device is able to send signals to drone only; it cannot control the camera actions. Thus your camera stays focused in only one direction all the time and have fixed focus during shoots. You cannot apply zoom, direction sensing inputs or focus adjustment controls when your device is in air. If you are searching for a highly controlled footage generator then it is good to go for other Phantom series and other competing models as per your budget. But Syma H5C is really a good choice to start with.
