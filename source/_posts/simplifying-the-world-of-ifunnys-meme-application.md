## Simplifying the World of iFunny's Meme Application

The iFunny meme app is an Android app that is designed for the specific purpose of providing funny photos, memes, and apps that you can download and share. It is a user-generated platform that allows users to download and upload funny images to the platform. It is a social media platform that is dedicated to the sharing of funny images and comes complete with all features that you would expect on a social media sharing site such as the ability to add additional content like comments, posts, and messages to other users.

When you first open the app or access the online version, you will see different types of memes displayed on the screen and you can just scroll down to find the meme that you would like to use. If you are looking for a specific meme, you can use the search tab and enter a keyword or tag to find the meme. There is also a section that displays the memes that are currently trending.

Here, we will look at iFunny and how you can use it to find the memes that you would like to use.

## How to Use iFunny Online

IFunny is easily accessible in any browser on any device. You can use the online version to find memes that you can download on to your computer. It is a good option when you don’t want to download the app version.

The following is how to access and use iFunny online. For the purpose of this tutorial, we are using the Chrome browser although the steps would work on any other browser.

Step1 Open your browser on your computer and go to <https://ifunny.co/> to access the main website. On the main page, you should see the latest iFunny memes. Just scroll down to see all memes and click on the one you would like to download.

Step2 If your goal is to upload your own meme so other users can access it, click on the “Add Meme” button on the left panel. You will however need to sign in to add a meme to the site. Enter your email and password to sign in. If you don’t have an account, click on “Sign Up” to create an account.

Once signed in, you should be able to not just add your own memes but also follow accounts and interact with other users.

Step3 if your goal is to find and download a meme that you want to use, you can use the categories on the left to narrow down the memes you want to download. Simply click on one of the categories to see all the memes available and when you find one that you like, click on it to open it, and then click on “Copy Link” to get a sharable link that you can post to social media.

## How to Use iFunny on Mobile

One of the best things about iFunny is that it is also available on mobile devices, you can just download the app from the Google Play Store to create and share memes on the go. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you use iFunny on Android.

Step1 Go to the Google Play Store and use the search function to find iFunny for Android. Tap on it when it appears in the search results, and then tap “Install.”

Step2 When the installation is complete, open the app and tap on the “Featured” button at the top.

Step4 Select “memes” then tap “Meme pics” and then select the meme that you would like to use.

You can also do this with images from the Photos app or Gallery on your device. Or you can use the search box in iFunny to find the meme you want.

Step5 If you would like to add a caption to the meme just to customize it further, tap on it and you will see the option to add a “Top Caption” and a “Bottom Caption.”

![top caption ifunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/top-caption-ifunny.jpg)

Type in the caption and the caption and then use the slider that appears below the meme to adjust the size of the caption.

You can then just save the meme to your device. If you would like to post the memes on to the iFunny platform, just tap “Next” and you should see the option to add tags and keywords to make it easier for others to find the meme.

The iFunny app, just like the online version also makes it very easy for users to find memes on the platform. In addition to the search tab that you can use to locate memes via keyword search, you also get several other options, including;

The “Featured” tab displays the best memes of the day. The memes listed here are updated every 8 hours, making it the best place to find the latest funny memes that others have shared or created.

The “Collective” tab also features some of the best memes created and posted recently, but it offers you the chance to search for the memes, GIFs, photos, and videos using various categories. This is the best option when looking for a very specific GIF.

The “Subscribe” tab is useful when you want to engage with other users on the app. Here, you will also find options to chat with other uses, like and comment on their memes

The “Explore” tab lists all the mems on the platform, neatly arranged in various categories. Since the content is user generated, there is no limit to the memes that you can find and download.
