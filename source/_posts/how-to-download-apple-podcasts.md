## Part 4\. Where Do Apple Podcast Downloads Go?

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Fix: Choose cellular data instead**

The steps for activating Cellular data access permission are as follows:

Step1 On your device, click on Settings. Then, choose the Podcasts option.
