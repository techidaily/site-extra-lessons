## Final Verdict

The two ways introduced above come in handy when you feel the need of changing video orientation or merging multiple videos into one. Also, when you do not want to go through any trouble of moving the videos to their computers first and then editing them, these apps give you way. We hope you found this post helpful and fulfilled your needs accordingly. You can now positively start rotating video on Android. Any experience shared would be appreciated. Thank you for reading!
