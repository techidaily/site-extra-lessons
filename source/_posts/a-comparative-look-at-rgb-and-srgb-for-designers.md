## A Comparative Look at Rgb and Srgb for Designers

You might have seen the phrase "color space" in your preferred post-processing program or camera settings. It alludes to the spectrum of colors that a photograph is capable of displaying. The two most popular color spaces are typically sRGB and Adobe RGB.

It's critical to understand the differences between these color spaces because they aren't always equivalent. Every option has scenarios when it is more suitable than others. Let's compare the sRGB and Adobe RGB color spaces and examine how these concepts are used in photography. Let's start!

## Part 1\. What Is sRGB?

Microsoft and HP created the sRGB RGB color space specifically for digital use. For computer screens and other digital devices like tablets and smartphones, it is the best color space to use. sRGB is now the standard color space as a result. SRGB is used by anything with computer-like skills.

All devices show sRGB images reliably, and it is easy to use. Additionally, it works well for printing from your neighborhood color lab. A computer monitor can display the majority of the sRGB color space, but only roughly 3/4 of the Adobe RGB color space.

## Part 2\. What Is Adobe RGB?

Adobe created Adobe RGB so that it would work with CMYK printers. It contains the same number of colors as sRGB, as was already explained, but they are distributed differently. So if you want to print your work properly, it gives you a wider range of vivid color to work with. Their main advantage is this. They can also be changed at any time to sRGB.

You'll see that when you submit a photo with an Adobe RGB color space to the web, the results appear flat and desaturated. This is due to the color being converted to sRGB by your browser. You should convert your files yourself before posting them because it does this fairly poorly.

## Part 3\. Which color space is the best?

The color space that best suits your needs is, as you might expect, the ideal color space. I advise setting your camera's color space to Adobe RGB. This will provide you with a larger range of colors to work with while editing and enable you to convert your files to sRGB later if you wish. Adobe RGB files are fantastic because it's simple to change them into sRGB for screen use. If you've ever sent pictures to stock photo agencies, for instance, you know that they typically want them in the Adobe RGB color space. The reason for this is that a customer acquiring a photo license has the option of printing the file or converting it to sRGB for usage on the web. Given that Adobe RGB's color spectrum is wider, you have more alternatives. Color space will also be influenced by your display. A larger color gamut is displayed on some monitors than on others. A similar number of colors are present in both SRGB and Adobe RGB, however, sRGB has a smaller color space. According to reports, Adobe RGB has a 35% broader color spectrum than sRGB.

Professional printers also have preferences when it comes to the color spaces they need. Save your files in the Adobe RGB color space if you mostly operate in web form but believe that you may need the greater color gamut that Adobe RGB can offer in the future.

## The Bottom Line

As a digital photographer, your main focus can be an artistic expression rather than the complex technical aspects of printing, which are frequently delegated to a professional printer. However, some of these technical concerns like color spaces start in-camera and can have a huge impact on how your photographs appear. It is essential to choose the right color space for your goals in order to achieve the greatest results.
