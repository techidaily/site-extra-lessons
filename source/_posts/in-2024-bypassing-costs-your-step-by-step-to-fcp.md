Starting from keyframe and Chroma key to video effects and audio mixing, everything is available under one roof. The feature of time-mapping and interpolations are perfect for advanced editors. You can choose from a wide range of 3d video and text effects. The platform supports over 70+ languages.

## The Bottom Line

The good news is that there is a Final Cut Pro trial version available. You can use the trial version for free for 90 days. Thereafter, you have to pay the one-time fee to get full access to Final Cut Pro for a lifetime. There is no doubt that FCP is one of the best video editors. But you should first check out the free version before spending money on the premium version for lifetime access.
