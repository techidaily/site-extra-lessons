The release of the first iPad ten years ago has opened a sea of opportunities for digital artists, and until today iPad Pro and iPad remain the preferred weapon of choice for designers and all other types of digital artists.

Unsurprisingly, there are hundreds of drawing apps that are compatible with the iPadOS, which makes finding the one that best fits your needs a somewhat complicated process. In addition, the range of drawing and painting tools varies, which can limit your options while performing complex drawing or painting operations.

That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the top ten drawing apps for iPadOS you can use just for fun or for professional purposes.

## Ten Best Drawing Apps for iPad and iPad Pro

Although all of the drawing apps we featured in this article are capable of great performances, they are not arranged in a particular order. However, we strived to include apps that are suitable for users at different experience levels. Here’s what the apps we selected have to offer.

### 1. [Affinity Designer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer-2-for-ipad/id1616833418)

**Price:** $19.99

**Compatibility:** iOS 11 or later, compatible with iPad

**User Rating:** 4.0

Much like its desktop version, Affinity Designer for iPad is equipped with all tools professional designers and digital artists need to create stunning imagery. The app is also compatible with the Apple Pencil and it offers touch controls, although you can only use it on iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, or 3 and versions of iPad that are produced from 2017 onwards.

Artists who work with vectors often are going to enjoy the Affinity Designer’s vector tools that enable them to apply live effects, perform the non-destructive Boolean operation or provide stabilization for brushes and pencils while they are drawing curved lines. What’s more switching between vector and raster workspaces requires a single tap, so that you can combine the two with ease. The app’s typography tools are equally impressive as you can choose the style of a single character or an entire paragraph.

### 2. [Inspire Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inspire-pro/id355460798)

The release of the first iPad ten years ago has opened a sea of opportunities for digital artists, and until today iPad Pro and iPad remain the preferred weapon of choice for designers and all other types of digital artists.

In addition, the range of drawing and painting tools varies, which can limit your options while performing complex drawing or painting operations.

That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the top ten drawing apps for iPadOS you can use just for fun or for professional purposes.

## Ten Best Drawing Apps for iPad and iPad Pro

Although all of the drawing apps we featured in this article are capable of great performances, they are not arranged in a particular order. However, we strived to include apps that are suitable for users at different experience levels. Here’s what the apps we selected have to offer.

### 1. [Affinity Designer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer-2-for-ipad/id1616833418)

**Price:** $19.99

**User Rating:** 4.0

Much like its desktop version, Affinity Designer for iPad is equipped with all tools professional designers and digital artists need to create stunning imagery. The app is also compatible with the Apple Pencil and it offers touch controls, although you can only use it on iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, or 3 and versions of iPad that are produced from 2017 onwards.

Artists who work with vectors often are going to enjoy the Affinity Designer’s vector tools that enable them to apply live effects, perform the non-destructive Boolean operation or provide stabilization for brushes and pencils while they are drawing curved lines. What’s more switching between vector and raster workspaces requires a single tap, so that you can combine the two with ease. The app’s typography tools are equally impressive as you can choose the style of a single character or an entire paragraph.
