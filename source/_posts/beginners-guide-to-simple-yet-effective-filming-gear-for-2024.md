 The market is swamped with [special camera equipment](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Many brands will claim to have perfect white balance, have the best zoom features, or be the most stable of all other video cameras. As a new film student or new hobbyist in film, it’s hard to know where to turn. As a beginner, you may get confused of choosing the [best entry-level digital camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

 We put together this guide to the best film cameras for beginners. You can [shoot a whole movie with your smartphone](https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/how-to-make-a-movie-on-your-smartphone.html), but if you want to play with the big leagues, you need equipment that matches. With that in mind, here is our guide to find the best film cameras for beginners, so you don’t get confused, lost, or disheartened.

## Part 1: The Best Film Cameras for Beginners

 So what are these miraculous cameras? Let’s find out what the best starter film camera is for you.

### 1. [Canon EOS Rebel 2000 35mm Film SLR Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Rebel-2000-Camera-28-80mm/dp/B00001QEMF/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=film%2Bcamera%2Bfor%2Bbeginners&qid=1583402467&sr=8-1&th=1"")

![Canon EOS Rebel 2000](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/canon-eos-rebel-2000-35mm-film-camera.jpg)

 The Canon EOS Rebel 2000 is a [35mm film](https://filmschoolonline.com/sample%5Flessons/sample%5Flesson%5FHD%5Fvs%5F35mm.htm) that makes one of the best film cameras for beginners. It comes with autofocus but full manual controls, should you need it. This touch lets you learn both ways should you want to. It’s also good for those who have a basic film camera knowledge, but that want to advance it.

 The Canon is arguably the best 35mm film camera for beginners because it also has a built-in 35-zone exposure system. This leads to less correction of your shot. As a bonus, it comes with 11 shooting modes, 7 stages of autofocus, and high-speed sync modes for faster uploading. All for such a great price, too.

**Pros of the Canon Rebel:**

* Fully automatic, built-in and retractable flash, super quiet running.
* High-speed sync, FE Lock, EX-series Speedlites and advanced flash metering.

**Cons of the Canon Rebel:**

* Not the best performance in low lighting situations, but that’s not the camera’s fault. Step one of filmography is making sure the lighting is good.

### 2. [Video Camera Camcorder Digital YouTube Vlogging Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Camcorder-Vlogging-Recorder-kicteck-Batteries/dp/B07MY3R7R9/ref=sr%5F1%5F14?keywords=film+camera+for+beginners&qid=1583402467&sr=8-14)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Video Camera Camcorder Digital](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/film-camera-camcorder-kicteck.jpg)

 This multifunctional camcorder is more like the handheld film cameras you will have grown up using, or seeing on TV. This is a great point and shoot film camera for beginners since it has easy controls that you will be familiar with from working a TV remote control. It has a fold-out screen which you can rotate towards either yourself or whatever you are filming. You can even use it flipped to record back on yourself – like a selfie!

 It’s great for vlogging because it lets you watch yourself. It also incorporates a webcam function, meaning it can upload and [live stream on YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at once. You can use this as a PC camera by connecting it to your laptop, where you enjoy USB 2.0 connection speeds. If you are a vlogger this is one of the best starter film cameras you can use to transition from your phone.

**Pros of the YouTube Vlogging Camera**

* It’s small and portable while still having loads of smart, web-specific features.
* Ideal for the budding Tik Tok star. Portable, lightweight, supports up to 32GB storage, two batteries that last up to 90 minutes each, and the ability to record while charging.

**Cons of the YouTube Vlogging Camera**

* No option for an external microphone. Tripod not included (you can pick them up for less than $10).

![The Canon AE-1 35mm Film Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/canon-ae-1-35mm-film-camera.jpg)

 The Canon AE is our next nomination for the best 35mm film camera for beginners' award. This is a Single Lens Reflex camera with auto-exposure monitoring and focal plane shuttering for precision filming. All lenses are compatible with anything in the Canon FD series, it also features coupling to that particular device, so it makes a great companion camera for stills.

 It comes with Canon Breech Lock mount and compatibility with Canon FL and R lenses. The camera uses a pentaprism fixed viewer for more than 90% accuracy and reflection of what the picture captures, which is high for any camera. As a bonus feature, it has a stopped-down meter needle and aperture scale for the viewing info. It’s the top class.

**Pros of the Canon AE**

* You won’t need a replacement. Perhaps ever.
* Reviewers compliment the light meter, shutter speeds, and photography class. One reviewer used the term work of art.

**Cons of the Canon AE**

* Higher cost than the others in our guide

![Video Camera 4K Camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/video-camera-aitechn.jpg)

 The 4K Camcorder is fourth on our list of the best point and shoot film cameras for beginners. This one might be the best starter film camera because it behaves like an on-set camera. It’s not a handheld as you know it. If you want to record straight to the web for your vlog but are scared of the microphone quality on the YouTube camcorder.

 The 4K is one of the best start film cameras because it comes with 48MP clarity. The camera digitally connects to Wi-Fi, uses a wide-angle lens, and even includes Night Vision. This feature doesn’t come as standard. The camera uses an IPS touch screen, comes with X-Y stereo pickup technology, and also has its sound boom.

It comes with autofocus but full manual controls, should you need it. This touch lets you learn both ways should you want to. It’s also good for those who have a basic film camera knowledge, but that want to advance it.

 The Canon is arguably the best 35mm film camera for beginners because it also has a built-in 35-zone exposure system. This leads to less correction of your shot. As a bonus, it comes with 11 shooting modes, 7 stages of autofocus, and high-speed sync modes for faster uploading. All for such a great price, too.

**Pros of the Canon Rebel:**

* Fully automatic, built-in and retractable flash, super quiet running.
* High-speed sync, FE Lock, EX-series Speedlites and advanced flash metering.

**Cons of the Canon Rebel:**

* Not the best performance in low lighting situations, but that’s not the camera’s fault. Step one of filmography is making sure the lighting is good.

## Part 1: The Best Film Cameras for Beginners

 So what are these miraculous cameras? Let’s find out what the best starter film camera is for you.

### 1. [Canon EOS Rebel 2000 35mm Film SLR Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Rebel-2000-Camera-28-80mm/dp/B00001QEMF/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=film%2Bcamera%2Bfor%2Bbeginners&qid=1583402467&sr=8-1&th=1"")

![Canon EOS Rebel 2000](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/canon-eos-rebel-2000-35mm-film-camera.jpg)

 The Canon EOS Rebel 2000 is a [35mm film](https://filmschoolonline.com/sample%5Flessons/sample%5Flesson%5FHD%5Fvs%5F35mm.htm) that makes one of the best film cameras for beginners. It comes with autofocus but full manual controls, should you need it. This touch lets you learn both ways should you want to. It’s also good for those who have a basic film camera knowledge, but that want to advance it.

 The Canon is arguably the best 35mm film camera for beginners because it also has a built-in 35-zone exposure system. This leads to less correction of your shot. As a bonus, it comes with 11 shooting modes, 7 stages of autofocus, and high-speed sync modes for faster uploading. All for such a great price, too.

**Pros of the Canon Rebel:**

* Fully automatic, built-in and retractable flash, super quiet running.
* High-speed sync, FE Lock, EX-series Speedlites and advanced flash metering.

**Cons of the Canon Rebel:**

* Not the best performance in low lighting situations, but that’s not the camera’s fault. Step one of filmography is making sure the lighting is good.

### 2. [Video Camera Camcorder Digital YouTube Vlogging Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Camcorder-Vlogging-Recorder-kicteck-Batteries/dp/B07MY3R7R9/ref=sr%5F1%5F14?keywords=film+camera+for+beginners&qid=1583402467&sr=8-14)

![Video Camera Camcorder Digital](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/film-camera-camcorder-kicteck.jpg)

 This multifunctional camcorder is more like the handheld film cameras you will have grown up using, or seeing on TV. This is a great point and shoot film camera for beginners since it has easy controls that you will be familiar with from working a TV remote control. It has a fold-out screen which you can rotate towards either yourself or whatever you are filming. You can even use it flipped to record back on yourself – like a selfie!

 It’s great for vlogging because it lets you watch yourself. It also incorporates a webcam function, meaning it can upload and [live stream on YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at once. You can use this as a PC camera by connecting it to your laptop, where you enjoy USB 2.0 connection speeds. If you are a vlogger this is one of the best starter film cameras you can use to transition from your phone.

**Pros of the YouTube Vlogging Camera**

* It’s small and portable while still having loads of smart, web-specific features.
* Ideal for the budding Tik Tok star. Portable, lightweight, supports up to 32GB storage, two batteries that last up to 90 minutes each, and the ability to record while charging.

**Cons of the YouTube Vlogging Camera**

* No option for an external microphone. Tripod not included (you can pick them up for less than $10).

### 3. [The Canon AE-1 35mm Film Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-AE-1-35mm-Film-Camera/dp/B00GTX4RCO/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?keywords=olympus+om1&qid=1583407442&sr=8-4)

![The Canon AE-1 35mm Film Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/canon-ae-1-35mm-film-camera.jpg)

 The Canon AE is our next nomination for the best 35mm film camera for beginners' award. This is a Single Lens Reflex camera with auto-exposure monitoring and focal plane shuttering for precision filming. All lenses are compatible with anything in the Canon FD series, it also features coupling to that particular device, so it makes a great companion camera for stills.

 It comes with Canon Breech Lock mount and compatibility with Canon FL and R lenses. The camera uses a pentaprism fixed viewer for more than 90% accuracy and reflection of what the picture captures, which is high for any camera. As a bonus feature, it has a stopped-down meter needle and aperture scale for the viewing info. It’s the top class.

**Pros of the Canon AE**

* You won’t need a replacement. Perhaps ever.
* Reviewers compliment the light meter, shutter speeds, and photography class. One reviewer used the term work of art.

**Cons of the Canon AE**

* Higher cost than the others in our guide

 The 4K Camcorder is fourth on our list of the best point and shoot film cameras for beginners. This one might be the best starter film camera because it behaves like an on-set camera.

 The 4K is one of the best start film cameras because it comes with 48MP clarity. The camera digitally connects to Wi-Fi, uses a wide-angle lens, and even includes Night Vision. This feature doesn’t come as standard. The camera uses an IPS touch screen, comes with X-Y stereo pickup technology, and also has its sound boom.
