This is one of the most convenient and easy to use app in GoPro's arsenal. Quik is a free application that would automatically create nicely edited videos within just a few minute's time.

However, you can only use the images and videos which are stored in your phone's library. You can also mix the GoPro footage with those of your phones if you want.
