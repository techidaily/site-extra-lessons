## Begin with No-Cost Video Intro Tools

Video intros are important in videography because viewers first see a video intro before the main video.

Learning about the two main categories of **video intro makers** gives you total control of your visual contents, irrespective of your need for the software. For example, you will learn about the uniqueness of editable and not editable free **video intro templates**. Read on and figure out how you may use individual video intro makers.
