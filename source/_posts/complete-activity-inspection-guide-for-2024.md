## Part 5: How To Add Motion To Your Video With Alight Motion Alternative

Some video editors prefer using desktop video editors because they can use multiple hard drives on it. High-definition footage requires a large amount of space that a smartphone can't offer. If a hard drive gets filled, you can change it with little or no interruption to your work.
