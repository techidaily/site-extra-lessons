## Difference Between Online Tool And Desktop Software

| Online Tools                                                                 | Desktop Software                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Online tools can be accessed through any device with an internet connection. | Desktop software needs installation and usually runs without an internet connection.              |
| Online tools need good internet connectivity to operate.                     | Desktop software speeds depend upon the processing power of your computer.                        |
| Online Tools usually have limited features as compared to desktop tools.     | Desktop software usually has more features than online tools.                                     |
| You don’t need to update or maintain online tools.                           | Desktop applications are often more sophisticated, but they require installation and maintenance. |

So, there are some critical differences between online tools and desktop software. It all depends upon your usage and preferences. If you prefer online tools, we will provide you with a list of some of the best tools you can use to brighten your videos. If you prefer desktop applications, you can use Filmora 11 Video editor.
