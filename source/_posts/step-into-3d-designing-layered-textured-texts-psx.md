## Step Into 3D: Designing Layered, Textured Texts PSX

It's three times better than regular text. A 3D text looks more professional, more creative, and just sits better on most pieces of content. Regardless of whether you need it for an image or for one of your videos. This guide will show you how to make a 3D text effect in Photoshop.

Then, you'll learn about an alternative method that's actually much easier. It may not be as popular as Photoshop but you will be surprised by the professional results even a beginner can achieve with this.

## How to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Photoshop

Photoshop is not the easiest image editing software to use. It can get really complex, really fast. But, with this, all you have to do is follow our steps. We'll try to make it as straightforward as possible.

Step1 Open up Adobe Photoshop and create a New Document. Then, edit the document settings like this.

![new document photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step2 Select the **Type** tool and choose a color of your liking. Then, click anywhere on the blank canvas and type in your word.

![type text photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/type-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step3 Now, locate the **Layers** panel at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click on **Layers** **→ right-click on your Text layer → select "New 3D Extrusion from Selected Layer".** Then, just click **Yes** on the new window that pops up.

![three d layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/layer-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step4 You are now editing in the 3D Workspace inside Photoshop. Here is where we will create the 3D text effect. First, click on the **Layers** panel **→ right-click on "Background" →** select **"Postcard".**

![edit background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/postcard-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step5 Now, without touching anything else, hold on to the **SHIFT** key and click on your text layer. This will select the text and background layer at the same time. Then, just hold on **CTRL + E / Cmnd + E**. This will merge the two layers.

Step6 Next, go to the 3D panel. Here, simply click on your Text layer. Then, from the **Properties** panel above, select a **Shape Preset** to be applied to your current text.

![properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preset-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step7 The next thing you need to do is add a light source. To do this, go back to the **3D Panel →** click on the **Lightbulb** button at the bottom **→** select **"New Infinite Light"**. Then, you can drag the circle in the middle of the text to set the direction of the light source.

![add light source photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/light-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step8 You can now go to the Properties panel to adjust the 3D effects and light source effects even further. When you are done, simply click this highlighted button to render your creation.

![render three d text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/render-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step9 We're almost done. The next step is to go back to the **Layers** tab → right-click on the **Background** layer → click on **"Convert to Smart Object".**

![convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-adobe-photoshop.png)

Step10 Finally, from the upper-right corner drop-down button, select **Essentials**.

![convert back](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/essentials-adobe-photoshop.png)

There you have it. You can now export your 3D text image from Photoshop and you're done. Congratulations on learning how to make a 3D text effect in Photoshop.
