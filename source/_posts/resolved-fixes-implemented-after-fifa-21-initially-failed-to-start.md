## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Change the compatibility and Run as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [End other processes](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Reinstall your game/ Battle.net client](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Change the compatibility and Run as administrator

 The privilege issue and compatibility mode might be the reason for this problem. With high integrity access, Destiny 2 can make full use of its features, running its function properly.

1. Navigate to the game installation folder.
2. Right-click on**Destiny 2 launcher.exe** and click**Properties** .
3. In the Compatibility tab, click **Run this program in compatibility mode for** . Then choose the system in the drop-down menu.

### Fix 2: Update your driver

 It is very important to update your graphics card drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter Destiny 2 won’t launch issue. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get a better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-destiny-2-wont-launch-pc/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/amd1-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

4. Relaunch the game and check to see if it could launch properly.

3. Reboot Destiny 2.

### Fix 4: Reinstall your game/ Battle.net client

1. Press the**Windows logo key + Pause** key together.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/control.jpg)
2. Set Control Panel**view by Category** and click**Uninstall a program** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/uninstall-1.jpg)
3. Right-click on Battle.net and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/battle.jpg)
4. [Download](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download/?platform=windows) the latest version and install it.
