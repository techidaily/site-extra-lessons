These encoders usually come in variable size ranges as portable boxes, smaller units or larger permanent type fixtures; all of them have different capabilities.

 The hardware type encoders are usually heavily priced and recommended for professional broadcasters. This category of encoders’ offers fixed video quality and users cannot make additional adjustments for its parameters. Hardware encoders demand much time for designing process as well as at development stage; you may often find few with older hardware components installed inside.

Note that, as hardware encoders have fixed set of arrangements to perform encoding process so they perform with higher speed as compared to software based encoders.
