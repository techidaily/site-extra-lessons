Step 7: Before adjusting anything, you need to lock your main tracks; this will ensure that you cannot accidentally move them.

Step 8: Click the small blurred area to highlight the blurred mosaic layer. You can now reshape, resize, and move it to the face that you want to pixelate.

Step 9: Click on the blurred mosaic layer and go to the upper left side of your screen, where you'll see that you have some options that allow you to adjust your blur effect.

Step 10: You'll see six different Mosaics that you can choose from; select the pixelated option. Choosing this option will immediately pixelate the face with the mosaic layer.

Step 11: You can adjust the pixelation size by increasing or decreasing the blur amount.

Step 12: Adjusting the opacity allows you to decide how transparent you want the blurred effect layer to be. Set it at 100 if you want the face to be unrecognizable.

Step 13: Once you are satisfied with your edits, click File at the upper left side of your screen and choose Save Project As or Save Project to save your video. The Save Project As option allows you to select the destination to save your project, while the Save Project saves it to the default folder.
