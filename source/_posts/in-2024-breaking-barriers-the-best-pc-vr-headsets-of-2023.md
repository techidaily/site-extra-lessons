### [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com)

[HTC Vive](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) wins the war of best VR headsets launched till now. It gives a most complete virtual reality experience to its customers.

Because it is the best product in the market for VR experience it is also very expensive.

### [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/)

Comparing to HTC Vive having its room-scale technology along with two of the included motion controllers [Oculus Rift](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) still considered to be the matching VR experience. Traditional game controllers are very much limited to a static virtual reality experience as compared to the Rift. Proper hand tracking is required to enjoy the immerse feel of the Rift.

### [Microsoft HoloLens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
