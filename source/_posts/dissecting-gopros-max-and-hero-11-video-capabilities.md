### **4\. Video Color Adjustment**

You can adjust the color of your video using advanced color correction presets available in Filmora. The platform features a number of pre-made templates for this purpose, including vignettes, film looks, and 3D LUT effects. Similarly, you can even save any custom color settings to apply to your videos according to the project’s requirements.

The process to use it is quite simple, as you need to double-click the color preset you want to use. Next, it will be applied automatically, and you can check what the video looks like.

Here are some other color adjustment parts you can use:

* **Exposure:** Adjusting this can make your video brighter or darker. A negative value darkens the colors, while a positive value lightens them. It's great for fixing images that are too bright or too dark.
* **Brightness:** Simply controls the overall brightness of your video.
* **Contrast:** This slider lets you fine-tune the contrast between light and dark areas in your video. Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.
* **Saturation:** Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.
* **Vibrance:** Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.

In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.

**HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):** HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.

* **Hue:** You can fine-tune the color's shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.
* **Saturation:** This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.
* **Luminance:** Control the brightness of the color range you've selected.

* **Vibrance:** Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.

In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.

**HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):** HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.

* **Hue:** You can fine-tune the color's shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.
* **Saturation:** This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.
* **Luminance:** Control the brightness of the color range you've selected.

2. From the Video tab, click on Lens Correction and select the checkbox to activate this feature.
3. Now click on the Select Profile option and choose your camera’s model.

### **2\. Video Speed Adjustment**

Here’s how you can adjust the speed of the video with Filmora:

1. Choose the video clip you want to adjust in the timeline.
2. Right-click on the clip and select "Speed and Duration. A pop-up window will appear.
3. To increase the clip's speed, increase the percentage (e.g., set to 200% for double speed).
4. To slow down the clip, decrease the percentage (e.g., set to 50% for half speed).
5. Click OK to apply the speed adjustment.
6. Preview the clip to ensure the speed suits your project.
7. You can further fine-tune the speed using the speed adjustment handles on the timeline.
8. Once satisfied with the speed adjustment, export the video as mentioned in the previous section.

### **3\. Stabilization**

If your footage is shaky for any reason, the Filmora stabilization feature can help fix that like a pro. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how it works:

1. Open the Filmora Video Editor and click Create New Project to kickstart editing.
2. Select the Import tab to browse the video you want to edit. You can even drag the video to the Media Library manually.
3. Right-click the video clip that’s appearing in the timeline and select the Stabilization option.
4. A brief analyzation of the video will happen. Once done, you can give some final touches to your content.
5. For example, you can adjust the smoothness level of graphics or select reflect, tile, or extend edges according to your project needs.
6. When done with the final tweaks, click OK.

### **4\. Video Color Adjustment**

You can adjust the color of your video using advanced color correction presets available in Filmora. The platform features a number of pre-made templates for this purpose, including vignettes, film looks, and 3D LUT effects. Similarly, you can even save any custom color settings to apply to your videos according to the project’s requirements.

The process to use it is quite simple, as you need to double-click the color preset you want to use. Next, it will be applied automatically, and you can check what the video looks like.

Here are some other color adjustment parts you can use:

* **Exposure:** Adjusting this can make your video brighter or darker. A negative value darkens the colors, while a positive value lightens them. It's great for fixing images that are too bright or too dark.
* **Brightness:** Simply controls the overall brightness of your video.
* **Contrast:** This slider lets you fine-tune the contrast between light and dark areas in your video. Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.
* **Saturation:** Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.
* **Vibrance:** Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.

In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.

**HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):** HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.

* **Hue:** You can fine-tune the color's shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.
* **Saturation:** This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.
* **Luminance:** Control the brightness of the color range you've selected.
