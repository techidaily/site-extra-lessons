Many people confused Blur with Opacity but blur refers to out of focus while opacity can be understood by fade in and fade out effect. You can adjust the horizontal and vertical blur amount separately and you can come up with stunning text animations by changing Blur value.

### 5\. Fill and Stroke

When it comes to text formatting in animation, fill color and stroke color play a major role. You can change the fill of the text so that the text animation is about changing color randomly. There are different options available for fill color such as RGB, Hue, Saturation, and likewise.
