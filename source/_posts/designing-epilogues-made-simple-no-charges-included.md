## Designing Epilogues Made Simple - No Charges Included

An outro video is as important as an intro video in videography and filmmaking. A video summary is an outro: you may see a video outro as the conclusion at the end of an article. Thus, your outro must be concise, captivating, and easy to digest. Outro templates are ready-made short videos, either editable or not editable**. Free outro templates** give you access to quality videography content, especially high-resolution outro template makers. Most outro template makers require basic design knowledge or give you all access to ready-made content: outro template for free download. Learn more about individual **video outro templates** below.

## Part 1: Editable free video outro templates

Filmstock editing comes in two asset types: Filmora Effects and After Effects. The two effects are suitable for everyday use, although you have to learn the basics of Filmora effects. Unlike After effects, the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) editor provides an editing theme: you can make several outro videos with a single theme by changing some variations.
