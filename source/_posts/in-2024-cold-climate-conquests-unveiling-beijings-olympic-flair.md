## 8\. Ukrainian Athlete Shows ‘No War' Sign During Skeleton Event

We are all aware of the tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their peak and there are many experts who believe the countries are on the verge of declaring war.

He showed the sign directly to the cameras after he finished his run at Beijing Olympics. It remains to be seen if any penalty will be imposed on him but Heraskevych has said that he is ready to face any repercussion even though he hopes that the Olympics will support him instead.

However, due to some miscommunication, she was allowed to be a participant in the team figure skating competition. She led the team to win gold but the medal is yet to be awarded due to the big confusion regarding the timeline of her drug test, suspension order, and miscommunication. The issue has become a controversial Beijing winter Olympics highlights.
