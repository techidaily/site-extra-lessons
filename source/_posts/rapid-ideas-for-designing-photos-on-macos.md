### 02**Choose Like-Minded Photographs**

If you don’t want to make your **Mac photos collage** look like a hot mess, then you’ll want to choose like-minded items. Look at the image below as an example. Each of them has the ‘faded’ pink-filtered kind of look. It makes these photographs great to put together on a collage But, of course, this is quite an extreme example of it. For you, this might just mean having the same people appear on one pic collage or choosing several photos from an event (i.e., holiday photos, party photos, trip photos, etc.)

You can set it up to tell a story, or in a way where one particular photograph catches more attention than the others, etc. Just consider the overall outcome when you’re putting your pic collages together And don’t be afraid to play around with placements whenever possible. Flip the photographs around, turn them over, remove one and replace them with another, etc., etc. Have fun with it, and don’t stop until you’ve got the perfect look down
