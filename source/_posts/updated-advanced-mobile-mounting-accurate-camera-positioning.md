We are halfway past 2020, and it’s time we put technology to good use and shoo away our filmmaking/ photography problems. Let us introduce to you the solution -- auto-tracking camera mounts that follow you around and automatically shoot whatever you want.

### 4\. Zhiyun Smooth 4

This one lives up to its tagline, ‘born for the mobile filmmakers’ owing to its superior features that assist you in creating professional content.

**Key Features:**

* Focus Pull and Zoom

Smooth 4 operates on an inbuilt handwheel configured into a focus puller that makes the experience so smooth. That combined with the powerful Phone Go Mode, whether its zooming or switching focus, the transition will never disrupt the aesthetics with this auto-follow camera mount.

* Lapses and Slo-Mos

Why limit to time-lapses when you can capture motion-lapse and hyper-lapses as well as detailed slow motions? These lapses are further complemented with the wide-range and triaxial modes to capture unbelievably artistic shots.

**Supported Devices:**

Compatible with all phones and accessories like LED lights and camera lenses.

**Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating: 4.5/5**
_With 200° tilt and 300° pan object tracking._

## **Which Camera Mount Should You Buy?**

All in all, each camera mount comes with its own USP, and you have to make a choice based on your priorities. When on a tight budget, you can compromise a bit on visual flexibility and go for Zhiyun Smooth 4\. For your DSLRs, nothing can beat Crane 2, just like Pivo is an undefeatable frontrunner for mobile phones.

## Top 5 Auto Tracking Camera Mounts 2020

Let’s take a look at the top auto-tracking camera mounts you can buy in 2020.

### 1\. PicBot

If we’re discussing auto-tracking camera mount, PicBot definitely deserves mention. With this mount, in one click, or no clicks at all, you can become a professional visual content creator.

When PicBot offers the features of clicking extensive panoramas, it comes equipped with an object tracking flexible enough for it. This auto-follow camera mount can turn a full circle when capturing videos and a complete left to right when capturing panoramic shots. This auto-tracking feature, however, is limited to **face tracking** and cannot follow inanimate objects.

**Key Features:**

* App Loaded With Features  
Timelapses and panoramas have never been as easy. With loaded features that work completely automatically, you can have your bot capture stunning visuals swiveling around the entire circumference of your landscape and being a steady cameraman for even the longest of time-lapses.
* Bluetooth 4.0 Control

For complete orientation, start-stop, and focus control, PicBot is equipped with a manually operated Bluetooth remote.

* Automatic Still Countdown

When you want to capture yourself sitting back and relaxing, PicBot offers you the option to do that without even pressing a single button. The motion detectors will detect when you’re still for a few seconds and the automatic still countdown will begin, capturing the perfect photo at the end.

**Supported Devices:**

Compatible only with the latest smartphones -- Android 4.3 & above and iOS 7 & above. The optimal weight that this bot can handle is 200g.

**Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating:**
_With 180°/ 360° object tracking._

This one lives up to its tagline, ‘born for the mobile filmmakers’ owing to its superior features that assist you in creating professional content.
