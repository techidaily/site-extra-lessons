As the name hints itself, this type of camera shot basically establishes the scene the audience sees as the [first shot of your movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishing%5Fshot).

In other words, the establishing shot provides the viewers a maximum of the city or the whole building scene in one frame.

This doesn’t help your audience guess what location is the scene is being shot but they can estimate the time when the scene is taking place.

With this type of [shot in the film](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you are typically showing and not telling the audience through narrative and it is completely enough to let the audience know the concept.

### 13\. Cut-In

This shot typically cuts the screen into two or three or sometimes four parts.

It is helpful when you have multiple things to be shown as important in one scene. It takes close-up of the thing that you want to show your viewer.

### 14\. Master Shot

A shot that is recorded from a single angle and is an uninterrupted shot to bring all the characters in view is referred to as the [master shot](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

It is basically the complete dramatized shot and can be edited together with other additional shots.

Also, this type of shot can be considered as the only shot to be used by a director for covering the scene. It can be a closer shot, full or long shot.

### 15\. Point of View Shot

POV or Point of View is a shot that focuses on what a character is trying to see in a scene.

The beauty of this type of shot is that the audience gets the picture of what’s going on in the character’s head.

For example, looking through the binoculars and shooting only where the character is seeing.
