<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step2 Start FFmpeg

First, you need to download a short clip. For instance, download the MPEG-4 media file at the link given below.

<https://ia802304.us.archive.org/28/items/cn%5Fepisodes/%20k.mp4>

**Output**

``` `` ```

Resolving ia802304.us.archive.org (ia802304.us.archive.org) ... 207.241.228.44

``` `` ```

Connecting to ia802304.us.archive.org (ia802304.us.archive.org) |207.241.228.44|:443... connected.

``` `` ```

HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

``` `` ```

Length: 4346697 (4.1M) \[video/mp4\]

``` `` ```

Saving to: ' k.mp4'

Video will be saved on your device. Now rename the file name with mp4\. Then check the below command:

`mv ' k.mp4' video.mp4`

`ls`

**Output**

`video.mp4`

### Step3 Check Media Files Information

Check and familiarize yourselves with basic metadata about video files. You can have this by using the -I command line argument without specifying an output.

`FFmpeg -i video.mp4`

**Output**

`Input #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'video.mp4':`

`Metadata:`

`major_brand : isom`

`minor_version: 1`

`compatible_brands: isomavc1`

### Step4 Extracting Audio from Video

There are two beneficial ways so we can extract audio from an input video file. You can achieve this by removing raw audio (without re-encoding it), or by re-encoding it.

A file not preceded by the -i command line switch is treated as an output file in FFmpeg commands. This software uses as many inputs and outputs as you provide. You can also specify the output file name using the –y command.

### Step5 Extracting an Audio Out of a Video File Without Re-encoding

`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec`

You can understand this part as removing only the video and leaving the audio. You can use the -vn command line flag to remove the video, then copy the audio file from the source to the destined folder without re-encoding it using the -acodec copy command line. Let's have a look at the below-mentioned command to understand.

If you executed the command utility, you could notice that your extracted audio file is under the name **audio.acc**, as we specified in the proceeding command ls

**Output**

`video.mp4`

It also allows you to use the -map flag to select all audio streams or a specific part of the audio.

`sudo apt update`

Ensure that the first command is implemented correctly. Type the below-given command and press **Enter** to install the project:

`Sudo apt install FFmpeg`

After implementing the preceding command, FFmpeg will be installed onto your device, and add the FFmpeg binary to the path variable. So now you can use the FFmpeg command in the command line.

### Step2 Start FFmpeg

First, you need to download a short clip. For instance, download the MPEG-4 media file at the link given below.

<https://ia802304.us.archive.org/28/items/cn%5Fepisodes/%20k.mp4>

**Output**

``` `` ```

Resolving ia802304.us.archive.org (ia802304.us.archive.org) ... 207.241.228.44

``` `` ```

Connecting to ia802304.us.archive.org (ia802304.us.archive.org) |207.241.228.44|:443... connected.

``` `` ```

HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

``` `` ```

Length: 4346697 (4.1M) \[video/mp4\]

``` `` ```

Saving to: ' k.mp4'

Video will be saved on your device. Now rename the file name with mp4\. Then check the below command:

`mv ' k.mp4' video.mp4`

`ls`

**Output**

`video.mp4`

### Step3 Check Media Files Information

Check and familiarize yourselves with basic metadata about video files. You can have this by using the -I command line argument without specifying an output.

`FFmpeg -i video.mp4`

**Output**

`Input #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'video.mp4':`

`Metadata:`

`major_brand : isom`

`minor_version: 1`

`compatible_brands: isomavc1`

`creation_time : 2012-09-04T13:47:56.000000Z`

`Duration: 00:01:54.99, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 302 kb/s`

`Stream #0:0(und): Video: (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p, 720x576 [SAR 1:1 DAR 5:4], 269 kb/s, 25 fps, 25 tbr, 100 tbn, 50 TBC (default)`

`Metadata:`

`Metadata:`

`creation_time : 2012-09-04T13:47:57.000000Z`

`handler_name: GPAC ISO Audio Handler`

`vendor_id : [0][0][0][0]`

### Step4 Extracting Audio from Video

There are two beneficial ways so we can extract audio from an input video file. You can achieve this by removing raw audio (without re-encoding it), or by re-encoding it.

A file not preceded by the -i command line switch is treated as an output file in FFmpeg commands. This software uses as many inputs and outputs as you provide. You can also specify the output file name using the –y command.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step5 Extracting an Audio Out of a Video File Without Re-encoding

`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec`

You can understand this part as removing only the video and leaving the audio. You can use the -vn command line flag to remove the video, then copy the audio file from the source to the destined folder without re-encoding it using the -acodec copy command line. Let's have a look at the below-mentioned command to understand.

If you executed the command utility, you could notice that your extracted audio file is under the name **audio.acc**, as we specified in the proceeding command ls

**Output**

`video.mp4`

It also allows you to use the -map flag to select all audio streams or a specific part of the audio.
