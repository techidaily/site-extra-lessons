## Part II. Storytelling's Potential on Your YouTube Videos Popularity

[Studies have shown](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.581349/full) from time to time that one of the best ways to grow an audience is through the concept of storytelling. This technique is absolutely crucial for platforms like YouTube since the average engagement span of your viewer is not going to be that high.

Telling captivating stories, however, results in audience retention, increases your watch time, and even has the potential to skyrocket your subscriber count. Here are some of the benefits that storytelling YouTubers gets by simply applying this technique:

### Benefit #1: Stories form a Deeper Human Connection

The main difference between the creators blowing on YouTube and the ones publishing a lot but not getting recognition is the story. YouTubers consistently put stories in their videos, allowing them to form a deeper human connection. Their viewers are educated and connected with that person, which is the reason for their success.

### Benefit #2: Stories help the Audience to Relate

A good story solves a problem and helps people to relate. Let's suppose you are doing a tech review. In this case, you definitely want to know what type of people are listening to you and how you can solve their problems.

Through story, your problem connects with theirs, and the audience starts relating with your content. This way, they won't be bombarded by facts and information and can immerse themselves as you talk about the tech gadget.
