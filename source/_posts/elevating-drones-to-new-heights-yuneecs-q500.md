It is also much easier to operate this device with joystick that can easily adjust the angles for flights. Beginners will find these controls much intuitive and it can help them to learn the advanced drone performance abilities with ease. You can generate left, rite, up or down movements with joystick and the drone behaves accordingly without causing any delay in response time. It is observed that Q500 can travel up to 17 miles in an hour when it is operated in Angle mode whereas 22 miles coverage is observed with Watch Me or Follow Me mode.
