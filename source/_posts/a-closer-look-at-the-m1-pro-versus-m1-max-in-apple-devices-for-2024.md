| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**              | 10-core                          | 10-core                                             |
| **GPU**              | 16-core                          | 24 or 32-core                                       |
| **Battery Life**     | 16 hours                         | 17-21 hours                                         |
| **Memory**           | 32 GB                            | 32 GB (Extendable to 64 GB)                         |
