## What Makes Video Presentation Different?

Looking for ways to make a presentation that stands out and keeps your audience engaged? Opt for Video presentations. Being much more appealing and interesting than regular cut-and-dry presentations, videos can deliver results. Some of the many benefits of using videos in your presentations are:

#### 1\.  Captures People’s Attention

Video presentations can grab the attention of the audience immediately. Videos offer you a delightful way to treat the audience, thus bringing your message to life in a way no other medium can. By incorporating interactive video presentation ideas, you can improve the viewer’s experience as well as utilize sound and sight to reel the audience in.

#### 2\.  Persuasive

Creating engaging video presentations can be a great way to persuade your target audience. Provoking emotional responses by incorporating audio-visual storytelling, adding sounds and sights into the mix, and bringing emotions can help you persuade your audience.

#### 3\.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere

People nowadays love spending time on their phones and tablets and so they prefer watching videos on them. This makes video presentations accessible anywhere, anytime. And with people becoming more reliant on technology at large, consider embracing videos to have a greater impact on viewers.

#### 4\.  Time Efficient

Video presentations are specifically meant to allow the presenter to break down the information into smaller chunks. This way, viewers can digest larger amounts of information easily and quickly. Making video presentations can thus be a more time-effective decision.

## 12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience

#### 1\.  Start With A Provocative Statement

Making a provocative statement when presenting your video can grab the attention of your audience right from the get-go. When your statement offers something a little controversial or maybe a bit offensive and unexpected, it makes people sit up and take notice.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Video Presentation Provocative Statement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-provocative-statement.jpg)

_“People don’t care about your brand.”_ Reading this, anyone will be compelled to see how the presenter justifies his/her point, isn’t it? The video begins with an unpredicted statement, explains why, and later shows what needs to be done for overcoming the hurdle.

#### 2\.  Narrate a Story

One of the most interesting video presentation ideas to grab your audience’s attention is telling a story that evokes their emotions. Narrating a personal story can work wonders as the audience can relate to it on an individual level. Think about some stand-out examples of human stories that relate to your business so that people can connect with the central character.

Here, Nike – one of the top brands in the world encourages women around the world to fulfill their dreams. Be it gender inequality or playing soccer, it asks women to do what they want.

#### 3\.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&A Session

Do you wish to get the audience involved? Ask questions right away! Questions and Q&A sessions break up the regular presentation rhythm and help in marking whatever you say as important. This way, you can turn your presentation from a boring activity into an active quest that your audience loves exploring on their own through answers.

#### 4\.  Use Visual Metaphors

Texts are less memorable and combining visuals with your message can help you grab the attention of the audience during your presentation. Visual metaphors are an excellent way to use images. In fact, visual images of situations that people are already familiar with help retain points much longer in their memory.

#### 5\.  Add Music

Music has the power to enhance and support emotions in video presentations, as well as proven to sustain the attention of people and help in information retention. As per the [research](https://www.ronberk.com/articles/2011%5Fresearch.pdf) of The John Hopkins University’s Ronald A. Berk, _“Music embedded throughout a PowerPoint presentation can sustain attention while slipping the content into long-term memory.”_ Incorporating music is one of the most amazing video presentation ideas you can take inspiration from.

#### 6\.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes

You’ve seen memes everywhere and you might even be sick of them. But, that doesn’t mean memes cannot be useful. In fact, using memes strategically can not only make your audience laugh but also surprise them.

#### 7\.  Add Motion Graphics

Motion graphics are an excellent way to illustrate an innovative idea with animated objects. When you add motion graphics in your presentation, it captures people’s attention instantly.

The video above shows how you can use motion graphics on the English alphabets.

#### 8\.  Use Quotes between Slides

Quotes can be great breathers between groups of informative slides. You can either use quotes to start new sections of information or to separate ideas inside your video presentation. Make sure that the quotes you are using represent the topic of your presentation. This way, you can be confident they will make complete sense and not leave the viewers confused.

#### 9\.  Add an Audio Narration

No matter how long or short your presentation is, narration can give it a completely different mood, especially if the words are heartfelt and the voice is powerful. Use the voice to change the pace or tone of your presentation and it will keep the audience to your video. Furthermore, adding an audio narrative into your slideshow can be an excellent way to create an interactive presentation experience.

#### 10\.  Play with Animations and Transitions

One of the greatest advantages of videos over the standard presentations is that you can do all kinds of trendy things. Animations and transitions can pull your audience in and help you bring focus to crucial areas and ensure that viewers engage with you. Video content lets you condense complex ideas in seconds, the video below from [Yum Yum Videos](https://www.yumyumvideos.com/) shows how to deliver messages in a compelling and empathetic way with explainer videos.

#### 11\.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic

Line up your slides vertically for creating a scrolling infographic rather than a classic slide by slide transition presentation. When the viewer scrolls down, the information fills every slide progressively. In fact, this technique is ideal for displaying video presentations online.

#### 12\.  End On A Meaningful & Strong Note

Looking for unique video presentation ideas that appeal to the audience? Your presentation will give you a lasting positive impression only if you end it right. It’s crucial to let the audience know what you want them to do next – visit a website, ponder an idea, or to take action towards a definite goal.

Furthermore, adding an audio narrative into your slideshow can be an excellent way to create an interactive presentation experience.

#### 10\.  Play with Animations and Transitions

One of the greatest advantages of videos over the standard presentations is that you can do all kinds of trendy things. Animations and transitions can pull your audience in and help you bring focus to crucial areas and ensure that viewers engage with you. Video content lets you condense complex ideas in seconds, the video below from [Yum Yum Videos](https://www.yumyumvideos.com/) shows how to deliver messages in a compelling and empathetic way with explainer videos.

#### 11\.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic

Line up your slides vertically for creating a scrolling infographic rather than a classic slide by slide transition presentation. When the viewer scrolls down, the information fills every slide progressively. In fact, this technique is ideal for displaying video presentations online.

#### 12\.  End On A Meaningful & Strong Note

Looking for unique video presentation ideas that appeal to the audience? Your presentation will give you a lasting positive impression only if you end it right. It’s crucial to let the audience know what you want them to do next – visit a website, ponder an idea, or to take action towards a definite goal.

## What Makes Video Presentation Different?

Looking for ways to make a presentation that stands out and keeps your audience engaged? Opt for Video presentations. Being much more appealing and interesting than regular cut-and-dry presentations, videos can deliver results. Some of the many benefits of using videos in your presentations are:

#### 1\.  Captures People’s Attention

Video presentations can grab the attention of the audience immediately. Videos offer you a delightful way to treat the audience, thus bringing your message to life in a way no other medium can. By incorporating interactive video presentation ideas, you can improve the viewer’s experience as well as utilize sound and sight to reel the audience in.

#### 2\.  Persuasive

Creating engaging video presentations can be a great way to persuade your target audience. Provoking emotional responses by incorporating audio-visual storytelling, adding sounds and sights into the mix, and bringing emotions can help you persuade your audience.

#### 3\.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere

People nowadays love spending time on their phones and tablets and so they prefer watching videos on them. This makes video presentations accessible anywhere, anytime. And with people becoming more reliant on technology at large, consider embracing videos to have a greater impact on viewers.

#### 4\.  Time Efficient

Video presentations are specifically meant to allow the presenter to break down the information into smaller chunks. This way, viewers can digest larger amounts of information easily and quickly. Making video presentations can thus be a more time-effective decision.

## 12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience

#### 1\.  Start With A Provocative Statement

Making a provocative statement when presenting your video can grab the attention of your audience right from the get-go. When your statement offers something a little controversial or maybe a bit offensive and unexpected, it makes people sit up and take notice.

![Video Presentation Provocative Statement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-provocative-statement.jpg)

_“People don’t care about your brand.”_ Reading this, anyone will be compelled to see how the presenter justifies his/her point, isn’t it? The video begins with an unpredicted statement, explains why, and later shows what needs to be done for overcoming the hurdle.

#### 2\.  Narrate a Story

One of the most interesting video presentation ideas to grab your audience’s attention is telling a story that evokes their emotions. Narrating a personal story can work wonders as the audience can relate to it on an individual level. Think about some stand-out examples of human stories that relate to your business so that people can connect with the central character.

Here, Nike – one of the top brands in the world encourages women around the world to fulfill their dreams. Be it gender inequality or playing soccer, it asks women to do what they want.

#### 3\.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&A Session

Do you wish to get the audience involved? Ask questions right away! Questions and Q&A sessions break up the regular presentation rhythm and help in marking whatever you say as important. This way, you can turn your presentation from a boring activity into an active quest that your audience loves exploring on their own through answers.

#### 4\.  Use Visual Metaphors

Texts are less memorable and combining visuals with your message can help you grab the attention of the audience during your presentation. Visual metaphors are an excellent way to use images. In fact, visual images of situations that people are already familiar with help retain points much longer in their memory.

#### 5\.  Add Music

Music has the power to enhance and support emotions in video presentations, as well as proven to sustain the attention of people and help in information retention. As per the [research](https://www.ronberk.com/articles/2011%5Fresearch.pdf) of The John Hopkins University’s Ronald A. Berk, _“Music embedded throughout a PowerPoint presentation can sustain attention while slipping the content into long-term memory.”_ Incorporating music is one of the most amazing video presentation ideas you can take inspiration from.

#### 6\.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes

You’ve seen memes everywhere and you might even be sick of them. But, that doesn’t mean memes cannot be useful. In fact, using memes strategically can not only make your audience laugh but also surprise them.

#### 7\.  Add Motion Graphics

Motion graphics are an excellent way to illustrate an innovative idea with animated objects. When you add motion graphics in your presentation, it captures people’s attention instantly.

The video above shows how you can use motion graphics on the English alphabets.

#### 8\.  Use Quotes between Slides

Quotes can be great breathers between groups of informative slides. You can either use quotes to start new sections of information or to separate ideas inside your video presentation. Make sure that the quotes you are using represent the topic of your presentation. This way, you can be confident they will make complete sense and not leave the viewers confused.

#### 9\.  Add an Audio Narration

No matter how long or short your presentation is, narration can give it a completely different mood, especially if the words are heartfelt and the voice is powerful. Use the voice to change the pace or tone of your presentation and it will keep the audience to your video. Furthermore, adding an audio narrative into your slideshow can be an excellent way to create an interactive presentation experience.
