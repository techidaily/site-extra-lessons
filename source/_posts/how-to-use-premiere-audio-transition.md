## How to Use Premiere Audio Transition

When a slide or clip is replaced by another, transition effects are shown. When editing video, there is a transition between every edit or cut. The easiest audio transitions in Premiere Pro are when you switch directly from one scene to the next. This enables a seamless changeover between scenes for the editor. To tie the scenes together and make the change from one scene to the next seem seamless, it usually happens gradually. The transition that seasoned videographers utilize most often is this one.

A scene or speech transition in which the audio gradually (or abruptly) lowers in volume are known as an audio fade out. If you want to know about how to crossfade audio in premiere pro, then we’ve got you covered. It is a common sort of transition that may be used to soften a transition between two clips or to smooth out a cut. However, switching between clips without any extra special effects might sometimes seem difficult to viewers. Follow the steps below to cross fade audio in Premiere Pro.

## Part 1\. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro

Let's briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms "fade-in" and "fade-out" refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Constant Gain

When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade's smoothness. Don't ignore it however; it does have its uses. You'll probably use this sparingly.

### Constant Power

In Premiere, the fade that dilutes the audio volume fluctuations between clips is represented by Constant Power. The second clip begins with a rapid spike and then decelerates at the conclusion of the transition. It produces a fluid, cinematic sequence that is understated yet high in quality. ideal for your next movie.

It is used to gradually reduce audio for the first clip at start, then swiftly when the transition comes to a close. It works by gradually speeding up at the conclusion of the transition before gradually reducing the audio for your initial clip. This crossfades raises audio in the second clip swiftly at initially and then more gradually at the conclusion of the transition.

### Exponential Fade

This crossfade operates in an exponential manner, beginning slowly before accelerating till the conclusion of the clip, giving the impression of a moving curve. An audio transition known as an exponential fade begins off slowly before gradually lowering or raising the level until it is finished. It works well for sequences with dialogue switches or for the conclusion. Without the abrupt flip, it provides a considerably shorter fade out that ends fast yet gracefully. Perfect for switching scenes with various atmospheres or for conversation.

## Part 2\. How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro
