## Part 1\. Best Final Cut Pro Plug-Ins

### 1\. Fx factory pro

Fx factory pro is one of the **best final cut pro plug ins** that users can try for free to access if the plug-in is suited to their video editing work. But while using the trials, fx factory pro would watermark the video, although, after purchase, it gets removed. Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.

If you are thinking about fx factory pro integration with **fcpx plug-ins**, you need not worry about that because the coordination between the two is off-charts. Many professionals looking for video editing websites consider Fx factory as their ideal destination for choosing plug-ins for their work.

### 2\. mLUT

Are you not satisfied with final cut pro X color grading software even though you don't necessarily hate it but want to see improvements in it? That's where the mLUT plug-in of motion VFX comes into the picture. Ideally, it is a free plug-in that video editors can use to look up their tables in one place together. One of the eye-catching features of mLUT from Motion VFX would ask your video to be shot in a longer format to get the best out of your color grading capabilities.

![mlut plug in](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/mlut-plug-in.jpg)

If you want to add more to your video editing, the paid version of mLUT packs offered by Motion VFX will allow you to add a cinematic look to your video efficiently. After all this, you find your video or image not perfect, so make sure you keep using it.

### 3\. Color Finale 2.0

Most people using final cut pro X were somewhat unsatisfied with the internally practical fast color correction tools. It was always about having something that properly allowed video color grading workflow. That is when color finale 2.0, a newer version of the initially released color finale, is known to come in handy. It is a new and more improved version of the previous one, which is optimized for having metal and more color management features such as ACES.

Do you want to add some classic distortion effects to the video or musical? For that distortion effect, plug-ins in your final cut pro X could be the ideal solution.

The black hole feature offered would drag your video image to a single location or point, and the Bulge feature would add an inward or outward bulge to the image. Next would be the circular zig-zag, a ripple-type effect that doubles the amount of refraction on the image.

Let the data speak for itself; if you are looking for this kind of tone in your movie or video scene, free data pop will help you achieve that.

### 9\. Distortion effects

Do you want to add some classic distortion effects to the video or musical? For that distortion effect, plug-ins in your final cut pro X could be the ideal solution. There are four unique effects that you can choose to add to your final cut pro X and modify upon it through some adjusting of its parameters.

The black hole feature offered would drag your video image to a single location or point, and the Bulge feature would add an inward or outward bulge to the image. Next would be the circular zig-zag, a ripple-type effect that doubles the amount of refraction on the image. And lastly, the twirl effect twists your clip to a certain degree to move it from subtle to extreme points.

### 10\. Shutter shock FCPX plug-in

Finally, the last one on our list is the shutter shock FCPX plug-in, which needed to be included, or the list would be considered incomplete for starters. This application allows you to inject or source royalty-free footage or images in your video project to add more flare to your work without leaving the application.

![shutter shock fcpx plug in](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shutter-shock-fcpx-plug-in.jpg)

While using the other plug-ins, users often needed to visit the respective site to preview the clip they edited. But, in the shutter shock FCPX plug-in, you can directly drop your work, and your clients will be able to preview them easily. After all these steps, when you consider the work done, purchasing the plug-in from the site will let your footage appear directly on your timeline without any watermark.
