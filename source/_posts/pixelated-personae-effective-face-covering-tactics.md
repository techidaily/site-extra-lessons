Step 11: You can adjust the pixelation size by increasing or decreasing the blur amount.

Step 12: Adjusting the opacity allows you to decide how transparent you want the blurred effect layer to be. Set it at 100 if you want the face to be unrecognizable.

Step 13: Once you are satisfied with your edits, click File at the upper left side of your screen and choose Save Project As or Save Project to save your video. The Save Project As option allows you to select the destination to save your project, while the Save Project saves it to the default folder.

## Conclusion
