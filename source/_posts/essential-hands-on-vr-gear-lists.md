### [1. Gloveone](https://www.neurodigital.es/ )

 This is a very sharp-looking couple of gloves, suitable just like the gloves people wear for BX or somewhat alike. One of the things to note, however, is that the keyboard, which lines the IMU, is immovable inside the logo that is present on the back of the user’ hand. An ingenious proposal, but somewhat to be alert of. We already talked about the qualities of having IMU’s on the separate fingers, and this glove ensures precisely that. It also features actuators on every fingertip. It is priced at $230 and is available online.

### [2. Manus VR](https://manus-vr.com/ )

 As VR pursues to develop more immersive with every new upgrade of hardware, peripheral creators are trying a thoughtful effort to cover the fact that you are using a controller. There are numerous gloves that need you to 'feel' virtual reality with your hands but Manus VR needs to plunge your whole arm. There is still some work to be thru getting the gloves out to designers but when that occurs, it’s likely that sometime later in this year or following, you are one more step closer to using your hands in virtual reality for real. It is priced at $250 and is available online.

### [3. Dexmo](http://www.dextarobotics.com/ )

 From the tech of Dextra Robotics a different type of VR glove is presented. This type is exoskeletal, which means that the gluttons are on the external, very noticeable, and kind of bulky.

The price is not released yet and is expected soon.

### 5\. Exoglove

 ExoGlove is basically a wireless virtual reality attentive wearable product intended to be used as a means of supervising games and surroundings. The technology in this product uses the built in stifles in order to trail the movement of hands and fingers. The haptic response is then used to signify the virtual objects present in the scene. They are capable of giving a feel of touching something into the game, and it is very helpful in generating a much more immersive experience and closing towards reality. The price of the object is unknown yet but expected to be announced soon.

## What is a VR Glove?

 The virtual reality technology provides visual and graphical experiences at best. It is all about upended in the mid of a scene and sensing immersed because you are watching everything in panoramic panache. But what if we talk about the touch sense? What is the better experience than being able to feel the weight and the sense of the things in the virtual world you are witnessing? When a user is feeling something, he is certainly out of the empire of the viewer and into the kingdom of a member of the action being performed.

 This technology is already present which can be experienced and the tactile nature of VR can be enjoyed. But only several people have hurried to implement it. Possibly a number of virtual reality adopters need to just get into some effective content by using their headset formerly moving forward to the next step. The user visualizes a lot of reserve funds being happening to obtain some of the many perks accessible in the VR world. Within a lot in the entertainment and gaming world to devote your money on, how heavy priority must VR gloves get to be?
