#### 4\. Virtual Home Button

Are you missing the home button feature on your iPhone X device? Unfortunately, it is not really possible to bring it back physically but replicating the home button is definitely possible with the use of the software. So, what is the procedure to get a home button replica? Go to the general, click on the accessibility feature, then click on the assistive touch, and finally toggle it on. A virtual home button appears on the screen which you may modify to activate the shortcuts.

#### 5\. Optimize Face Id

However fast the face ID is, at times, it cannot match up with the touch ID. But, the process of face ID can be accelerated with right habits and settings.

Firstly, click on the settings and then on the display and brightness feature to ensure “raise to wake” feature is enabled to stop you from having to tap on the screen. Swipe the phone upside so that your face is not seen directly on the screen and the face id gets time to authenticate and when you look to unlock your iPhone with the face ID, it directly takes you to the home screen. You may click on settings and then passcode and face ID to find the “require attention for face ID” feature to unlock the phone without looking directly on the screen. These iPhone X tips and tricks can greatly help to optimize the face ID.

If there’s an opened app screen on your iPhone X, you may go back to the home screen by using the home indicator. And, if multiple app pages are opened on your device’s home screen, you may swipe from the bottom edge which takes you back to the first page.

#### 4\. Virtual Home Button

Are you missing the home button feature on your iPhone X device? Unfortunately, it is not really possible to bring it back physically but replicating the home button is definitely possible with the use of the software. So, what is the procedure to get a home button replica? Go to the general, click on the accessibility feature, then click on the assistive touch, and finally toggle it on. A virtual home button appears on the screen which you may modify to activate the shortcuts.

#### 5\. Optimize Face Id

However fast the face ID is, at times, it cannot match up with the touch ID. But, the process of face ID can be accelerated with right habits and settings.

Firstly, click on the settings and then on the display and brightness feature to ensure “raise to wake” feature is enabled to stop you from having to tap on the screen. Swipe the phone upside so that your face is not seen directly on the screen and the face id gets time to authenticate and when you look to unlock your iPhone with the face ID, it directly takes you to the home screen. You may click on settings and then passcode and face ID to find the “require attention for face ID” feature to unlock the phone without looking directly on the screen. These iPhone X tips and tricks can greatly help to optimize the face ID.

#### 6\. Quickly Return Home

If there’s an opened app screen on your iPhone X, you may go back to the home screen by using the home indicator. And, if multiple app pages are opened on your device’s home screen, you may swipe from the bottom edge which takes you back to the first page.

#### 9\. Use Reachability Again

Do you miss the reachability feature where the display would slide down to reach the icons with one hand on the top of the screen by just a double touch on the home button? Why miss, when you can get it? Yes, the feature has not been removed from the iPhone X but it has just been hidden. Go to the general settings, click on the accessibility feature and scroll down to interaction to enable the reachability. For using the reachability feature, on the home bar bottom of the screen instantly swipe.

#### 10\. Flip Between Recent Apps

This is a familiar iPhone X functionality but you might have missed it while setting up your device. It is common for all of us to go through the tutorial quickly and then get to the phone. Isn’t it? But, if you have still missed it, then, from the home screen swipe right on the gesture bar. Now, you can quickly get into flipping between suspended apps. Furthermore, if you have flipped to an app that was not the last opened app, you can swipe both left and right.
