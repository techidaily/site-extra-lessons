We are all aware of the tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their peak and there are many experts who believe the countries are on the verge of declaring war.

She led the team to win gold but the medal is yet to be awarded due to the big confusion regarding the timeline of her drug test, suspension order, and miscommunication. The issue has become a controversial Beijing winter Olympics highlights.
