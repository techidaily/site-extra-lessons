## Part1: What is Animoji?

First things first! You should have deep insight into what exactly is Animoji on iPhone X before going further for its usage. After making people familiar with emojis, here comes Animoji which Apple has attempted to make your facial expressions get mimicked by some popular emojis. Animoji is basically a portmanteau i.e. a word made by blending of two words – ‘Animated’ and ‘Emoji’.

iPhone X has embraced Face ID facial recognition technology which is what this Animoji feature uses. The TrueDepth camera scans a user’s face to make the emojis imitate their expressions. Not just expressions, the Animoji on iPhone X matches exactly what you say and where your face position is and how you move your head.

Currently there are 12 emoji characters that work this way. However, 4 more are expected to come soon with the new update of iOS 11.3\. Right now, the users can take delight with animals including panda, cat, dog or robot or even a pile of poo emoji. Isn’t this interesting? Wouldn’t it be funny to see yourself being an alien or a unicorn uttering your words? But how you can do this? Only by scrolling down!
