## How much video can 64GB hold?

Based on the normal video resolution of 4k at 60fps, a 64GB storage device can keep more than 1 hour and 20 minutes of video time.

A 64GB storage device can hold more than 1 hour and 37 minutes of video at a resolution of 2.7k at 120fps. On a 64GB memory card, recording at a resolution of 1080p at 60fps allows for around 5 hours of video time.

## How much video can 128GB hold?

A 128GB memory card may carry about 75 or 76 videos if each film is only 3 minutes long.

The data rate of movies is generally influenced by the format and codec of the videos. When this happens, the time it takes for a memory card of that capacity to fill up can be affected. A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of video at 1080p HD. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen.

A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of footage at 1080p at 4k resolution. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen. A standard 128GB memory card can hold up to 48 hours of film at 720p at 4k resolution. A data rate of roughly 4.42MB/s is also required.
