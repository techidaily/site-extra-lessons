People these days are spending much time on action camera shooting as it can provide impressive footage. However, the sad part is that the audio signal suffers from distortion when mics are connected through protective cases. Moreover, waterproof cases never even allow access to mic ports directly.

In such cases, we need to buy additional protective cases or frames that can allow easy connectivity with audio ports. As the latest designs of GoPro do not possess audio jack so in that case you need a microphone adapter to capture sound without distortion.

Below are few details about some of the **best microphones that can be used with Action Cameras** to achieve improvement over sound quality. The products listed below are not in a particular order.

## Part 2: Different Types of Microphones: Lavalier microphone and shotgun mics

Typically, there are two types of microphones, one is the lavalier mic, and the other is the shotgun mic.

**Lavalier microphones** often come in cardioid and omnidirectional configuration and are suitable for a wide variety of applications. They are small in size and can be easily attached to clothing while keeping hands free. These mics are also called as tie-clip mics or lapel mics. Lavalier mics are most suitable for the voice that is in close proximity whereas they cannot be used for ambient music.

On the other side, **shotgun mics** are developed to serve medium angle shots with impressive results. They assist in better focusing while avoiding the off-axis noise and improve performance with its tight polar pattern. These mics can be easily used for outdoor shooting needs as they can resist wind.

## Conclusion

There is no doubt to say that you can find huge varieties of microphones in the market for GoPro devices. But your selection must be fair and careful. A good quality microphone offers decent functionality with impressive audio quality. Some of these products allow Bluetooth connectivity so that audio signals can be recorded from distance places whereas others are connected through wires. You can easily pick any design out of all discussed above as per your budget and needs. All these products can be ordered from Amazon at a decent price range.

## Part 2: Different Types of Microphones: Lavalier microphone and shotgun mics

Typically, there are two types of microphones, one is the lavalier mic, and the other is the shotgun mic.

**Lavalier microphones** often come in cardioid and omnidirectional configuration and are suitable for a wide variety of applications. They are small in size and can be easily attached to clothing while keeping hands free. These mics are also called as tie-clip mics or lapel mics. Lavalier mics are most suitable for the voice that is in close proximity whereas they cannot be used for ambient music.

On the other side, **shotgun mics** are developed to serve medium angle shots with impressive results. They assist in better focusing while avoiding the off-axis noise and improve performance with its tight polar pattern. These mics can be easily used for outdoor shooting needs as they can resist wind.

## Conclusion

There is no doubt to say that you can find huge varieties of microphones in the market for GoPro devices. But your selection must be fair and careful. A good quality microphone offers decent functionality with impressive audio quality. Some of these products allow Bluetooth connectivity so that audio signals can be recorded from distance places whereas others are connected through wires. You can easily pick any design out of all discussed above as per your budget and needs. All these products can be ordered from Amazon at a decent price range.

People these days are spending much time on action camera shooting as it can provide impressive footage. However, the sad part is that the audio signal suffers from distortion when mics are connected through protective cases. Moreover, waterproof cases never even allow access to mic ports directly.

In such cases, we need to buy additional protective cases or frames that can allow easy connectivity with audio ports. As the latest designs of GoPro do not possess audio jack so in that case you need a microphone adapter to capture sound without distortion.

Below are few details about some of the **best microphones that can be used with Action Cameras** to achieve improvement over sound quality. The products listed below are not in a particular order.

## Part 2: Different Types of Microphones: Lavalier microphone and shotgun mics

Typically, there are two types of microphones, one is the lavalier mic, and the other is the shotgun mic.

**Lavalier microphones** often come in cardioid and omnidirectional configuration and are suitable for a wide variety of applications. They are small in size and can be easily attached to clothing while keeping hands free. These mics are also called as tie-clip mics or lapel mics. Lavalier mics are most suitable for the voice that is in close proximity whereas they cannot be used for ambient music.

On the other side, **shotgun mics** are developed to serve medium angle shots with impressive results. They assist in better focusing while avoiding the off-axis noise and improve performance with its tight polar pattern. These mics can be easily used for outdoor shooting needs as they can resist wind.

## Conclusion

There is no doubt to say that you can find huge varieties of microphones in the market for GoPro devices. But your selection must be fair and careful. A good quality microphone offers decent functionality with impressive audio quality. Some of these products allow Bluetooth connectivity so that audio signals can be recorded from distance places whereas others are connected through wires. You can easily pick any design out of all discussed above as per your budget and needs. All these products can be ordered from Amazon at a decent price range.

People these days are spending much time on action camera shooting as it can provide impressive footage. However, the sad part is that the audio signal suffers from distortion when mics are connected through protective cases. Moreover, waterproof cases never even allow access to mic ports directly.

In such cases, we need to buy additional protective cases or frames that can allow easy connectivity with audio ports. As the latest designs of GoPro do not possess audio jack so in that case you need a microphone adapter to capture sound without distortion.

Below are few details about some of the **best microphones that can be used with Action Cameras** to achieve improvement over sound quality. The products listed below are not in a particular order.
