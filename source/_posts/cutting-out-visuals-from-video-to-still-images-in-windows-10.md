## Part 2: Why I can’t save photo from video

In case, you are not able to save photos from video on Windows 10 Photos App. There might be issues with an outdated [Microsoft OS patch update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/311047/how-to-keep-your-windows-computer-up-to-date) or the Microsoft account is having any problem. But, you don’t have to worry about the same.

We are explaining the solutions here –

### 1\. Check the update

Click on ‘Start’ > ‘Settings’ > ‘Update & Security’ > ‘Windows Updates’ > ‘Check for Updates’ > ‘Update Available’. When update is available, go ahead and follow the prompts to get the update.

### 2\. Sign in a different account in Microsoft Store

You got to login with another Microsoft account to access Microsoft Store. It might be your existing Microsoft Store account undergoing some issues. This in turn might be affecting the Photos app from acting properly. Therefore, signing in a different account will help.
