## Why We Need to Distort Pic

In digital photography, distortion occurs when you deviate an observed pixel from its anticipated coordinate in a 2D plane, resulting in a more curvilinear appearance that appears unnatural to the viewer's eye. People use it as a form of effector to share their perspectives. You can distort pic for various reasons. They include:

#### 1\. Allows You to Have Fun

Adding distortion effects to your pic is a fun thing to do. It's always interesting to see what things will look like after adding distortion filters to your photo. You can have an enormous amount of fun, creativity, craziness, and laughing with your pics.

#### 2\. Helps You a Distinct Look

One of the simplest ways of making your pics distinct is by adding distortion effects. These effects can make your images stand out within seconds. Because it allows you to create eye-catching pics by adding instant charm, distorting pics can help you attract viewers to your work. Therefore, you can use this effect to wow your friends and audience.

### How to Distort a Picture Using an Online Tool

These online tools offer multiple photo distortion filters and effects that you can add to your image and distort its look. After applying a filter, you can manually adjust the intensity of your distortion filter to suit your preferences.

Some of the images you can distort using online tools include:

* Over-Exposition: This is when the person in the photo is too bright or overexposed to show the subject's features.
* Under-Exposure: This is when the person in the photo is too dark or under-exposed to show the subject's features.
* Visual Stretching is when you digitally stretch an image to the desired size, sometimes using a "zoom" feature to get closer or broader shots of the subject.

Photomosh.com is one of the online tools that people use to edit images online. You can use it to distort photos to create new visual content that showcases your creativity and personality; this website is user-friendly and allows you to create your photo distortion quickly.

### How to Distort a Picture on Mobile

Uploading pics on social media is exciting. But sometimes it can be boring if you display the same expression numerous times. Luckily, there are many distorted face apps for iOS and Android mobile devices.

Playing with expressions can be enough to create funny photos. Sometimes a face distortion app is what you need to produce unique images for a different purpose, including annoying close people, jokes, and memes. A distorted face app can turn a pic into an unrecognizable image after completely editing it.

Photo Warp is one of the best distortion apps for Android and iOS devices. The app allows you to get more creative with your pics.
