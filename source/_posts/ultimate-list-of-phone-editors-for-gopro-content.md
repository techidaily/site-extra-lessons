## Part 1: GoPro Video Editing App for Android

### 1.Quik

This is one of the most convenient and easy to use app in GoPro's arsenal. Quik is a free application that would automatically create nicely edited videos within just a few minute's time. The editing process is as simple as it can possibly get; all you have to do is selecting the videos or pictures which you would like to show in the movie from the library and Quik is going to do the rest. However, you can only use the images and videos which are stored in your phone's library. You can also mix the GoPro footage with those of your phones if you want.

Antix is a special kind of application that makes use of the motion sensors of your smartphone in order to detect when some exciting action is happening.

You can also choose to add any background sound to your video wither from the mic of your phone or from a preselected list of licensed tracks.
