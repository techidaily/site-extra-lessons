Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location.

However, the website does not have a very intuitive interface, even though it is easy to navigate. The ads that pop up might get frustrating and distracting after a while. Apart from that, the images are directly downloaded into your computer without you first having a look at them, making it difficult to choose if you want to look at multiple pictures before deciding on one.
