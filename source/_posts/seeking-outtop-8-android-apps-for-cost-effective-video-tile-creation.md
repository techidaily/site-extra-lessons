#### 4. Adobe Premiere Clip

If you are a fan of the Adobe Suite of applications, you will love using Adobe Premiere Clip to create photo and video collages. It offers powerful features that are not available on some of the other apps, but it is a little bit harder to use if you have never edited like this before.

Features:

* Automatic video creation that includes images and soundtracks of your choosing.
* Ability to drag and drop clips in the order and space that you want.
* Use Adobe Capture CC to edit the appearance of your photo or video collage.

## Conclusion

While these eight apps will serve you very well for editing collages on your phone, they do have limitations. If you want to create the perfect video collage for a special moment, you will have an easier time using a desktop computer. Here I would like to recommend Filmora. It is a program you can use on your computer to create the perfect video collage with powerful editing tools. Try it for FREE.
