## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

![ppt playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ppt-playback.jpg)

Play in Background helps automatically start the audio file during a slide show and makes the audio play throughout the multiple slides.

## Part 4 Add more songs to a PowerPoint presentation

You can add more songs if your slide show plays longer than one song. Yet, find that you're having difficulty synchronizing the Audio with the PowerPoint slideshow. For this purpose, you can use a third-party audio editing tool, such as Wondershare Filmora, to combine the Audio into one file and enjoy it all together. And, this makes how to insert music in PowerPoint even easier than before. Here, we'd like to show you a tutorial on using Wondershare Filmora to add music to PowerPoint indirectly but more interestingly so that you don't have to work for longer.

##### Step1 Download Filmora and launch it

Click the Free Download button in the Wondershare Filmora to install it on your PC and then launch it.

Before you do a new project, you can select the aspect ratio as per the requirements. And hit the New Project and continue.

##### Step2 Import Photos and Music

You can import music media to the Media Library and then directly drag and drop them to the timeline.

##### Step3 Add Transitions

![add transitions filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-slideshow-transitions.jpg)

There are multiples of transitions available in Filmora to choose among. You can apply a particular transition between each selected photo or apply random transitions as per your interests.

Filmora features 30 plus transitions, especially for Slideshow or PowerPoint presentations, such as cross split, cross merge, swap, and sweep clockwise. You can also use 3D transition, speed blur, or ripple and dissolve transitions.

Moreover, you can accordingly adjust the duration of the transition.

Filmora features the voiceover recording tool, which assists you in recording your voice easily.

![add background music filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-music-slideshow-filmora9.jpg)
