Live Photos is an excellent feature of the iPhone to add motion to your picture. People have used the feature extensively since it was introduced in 2015 with the iPhone 6s.

Fortunately, you can now convert Live Photo to video with the launch of iOS13\. You can create small videos out of your Live Photos and retain sound and motion. Plus, you can share the videos anywhere you wish without restrictions.

In this post, we will learn how to turn a Live Photo to video using some easy ways.
