### 2\. Motion Tracking  

Motion Tracking is available in Filmora 11 and is really beautiful!  
Motion tracking is to track the movement in your video, a person, hand, or even a scenery. Once the movement has been tracked you can add text or images or other objects to follow the same movement. We have seen motion tracking being used as animations, and labels to follow a person or an object like gaming or to hide some sensitive content.  
We are going to learn step by step how to use Motion tracking in Filmora 11 to make someone’s name follow them right now!  
Let us dive in…
