## Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy

You can do a lot of things with your WhatsApp fonts, appearance, and texts that will make your messages look oh-so-edgy! From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.

#### 1.Bold

Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (\*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the \* and the letter.

![Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg)

#### 2.Italic

Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( \_text\_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.

![Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg)

#### 3.Strikethrough

Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (\~text\~) at the starting and end of your text.

![Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png)

#### 4.Monospace

The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (\`\`\`text\`\`\`) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.

#### 5.Disable Read Recipients

WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings >> Account >> Privacy >> Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.

#### 6.Pin Prioritized Contacts

Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.

#### 7.Export Chat Logs

If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click >>More<< and then click on >>Export Chat<<. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.

#### 8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting

Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.

#### 9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence

There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!

![Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png)

#### 10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing

While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!

## What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?

Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.

#### 1.Broadcast Announcements

Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.

#### 2.Save More Data

There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.

![Whatsapp Save More Data](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png)

#### 3.Share Your Location Without Ado

If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.

#### 4.Search Old Chats with Keywords

As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.

![Whatsapp Search Old Chat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png)

#### 5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats

Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.

#### 6.Snooze WhatsApp

Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings>> Apps and Notifications >> WhatsApp >> Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.

![Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png)

#### 7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days

Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.

![Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png)

#### 8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See

If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see. Go to Story and tap and hold the unwanted contact to open the Mute option. Even though there is no option that you can stop the automatic carousel to the next contact’s stories altogether, you can always go by the rule of the thumb - place your thumb on the screen and the carousel won’t move.

![Mute Whatsapp Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-whatsapp-stories.jpg)

#### 9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group

This is as simple as it sounds. Tap and hold to select a message in a group and then open the 3-dot button at the top right to access the feature.

#### 10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts

Manage how you are notified of messages from specific contacts and groups. Go to the main page of the contact or group you wish to customize, and there you will find Custom Notifications. Activate the mode to open a wide range of options - notification tones, pop up, preview, etc.

## Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease

Some of the best WhatsApp video editing tricks are coming up, wherein you can add doodles, text, and crop an image. Moreover, you also check in some external video editing tools that are quite handy to integrate with WhatsApp.

#### 1.Download & Edit WhatsApp Video from A Contact’s Status

There are no download options for photos and videos for WhatsApp Statuses, yet you can have it on your PC, iPhone, and Android device and surprise a loved one by editing the videos they did not send you personally. To do this, you can go to File Manager >> Settings >> Turn on Show Hidden Files; after doing this go back to Internal Storage >> WhatsApp >> Media >> Statuses. Once you have the Video, you can import it to Filmora and use a gamut of video editing tools to create the magic!

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2.Record Video Calls from PC and Improve Its Quality

For this WhatsApp Video Editing Trick, you would need to have a third-party screen recorder tool, like Wondershare Filmora on your PCs, and the iPhone 11 has one in-built software for screen recording. Either way, if you can record the WhatsApp Call with sound and all, you can further import the file into Wondershare Filmora and use high-tech editorial tools like Noise Reduction, 4K Resolution and snip any unnecessary portions in the clip.

#### 3.Snip Out a GIF from a Video

You can create an instant GIF out of the video file within WhatsApp. Do this, let the video download, and then freshly share it from Attach >> Gallery >> Videos. Before sending, the video editing panel would open, there, you can see the GIF option at the top right. It will shorten your video to 6 seconds, adjust the cursor to the portion you wish to use.

#### 5.Disable Read Recipients

WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings >> Account >> Privacy >> Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.

#### 6.Pin Prioritized Contacts

Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.

## What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?

Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.

#### 1.Broadcast Announcements

Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.

#### 2.Save More Data

There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.

![Whatsapp Save More Data](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png)

#### 3.Share Your Location Without Ado

If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.

#### 4.Search Old Chats with Keywords

As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.

![Whatsapp Search Old Chat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png)

#### 5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats

Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.

#### 6.Snooze WhatsApp

Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings>> Apps and Notifications >> WhatsApp >> Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.

![Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png)

#### 7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days

Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.

![Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png)

#### 8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See

If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see. Go to Story and tap and hold the unwanted contact to open the Mute option. Even though there is no option that you can stop the automatic carousel to the next contact’s stories altogether, you can always go by the rule of the thumb - place your thumb on the screen and the carousel won’t move.

![Mute Whatsapp Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-whatsapp-stories.jpg)

#### 9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group

This is as simple as it sounds. Tap and hold to select a message in a group and then open the 3-dot button at the top right to access the feature.

#### 10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts

Manage how you are notified of messages from specific contacts and groups. Go to the main page of the contact or group you wish to customize, and there you will find Custom Notifications. Activate the mode to open a wide range of options - notification tones, pop up, preview, etc.
