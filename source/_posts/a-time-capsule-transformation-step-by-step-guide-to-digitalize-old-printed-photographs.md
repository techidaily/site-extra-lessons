## Step 1: Choose the way to go about digitizing your printed collection of Stills

#### 1. For the highest quality: Use a Scanner

 To enjoy a dust free collection, it is good to create your own scanning station. In order to obtain the best results, remove any dust or dirt from your prints using a specially designed microfiber cloth or you can prefer to use an alcohol based cleaning wipe. You have to clean both scanner as well as photos for better details. Note that scanner is a highly sensitive device so it can immediately process the presence of even a small dust particle on your image. The best tips for high quality scan creation are:

* It is goof to scan multiple stills at a time and you can crop them later.
* It is good to work with a resolution of a least 300 dots/inch and you can go ahead with 600 dpi selection for large enlargements.
* Editing options can further provide finer results.

#### 2. Use your Phone to Scan Photos

 Second recommendation is to do photo scan apps on iOS and Android devices. For this, you may need a high resolution camera from big brands like Galaxy 7, Pixel or iPhone 7 etc. Most of these applications are able to process only one photo at a time and then few fancy computing techniques can be applied ahead to improve the quality.
