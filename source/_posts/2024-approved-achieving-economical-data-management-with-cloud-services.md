The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.

We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, **cloud storage pricing** is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.

## Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison

Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers' free storage space and their **cloud storage pricing comparison**.

| Cloud Storage Providers | Free Storage | Monthly Price                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |

However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don't wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.

The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.

If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud. They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.

For secure cloud storage services, especially for more official, commercial, and professional users, pCloud will always be the first option that comes to mind.

* 10 TB storage for Custom storage.

**#2\. Icedrive**

You can choose between monthly, annual, and lifetime subscriptions with Icedrive. Each offers three different cloud storage options (from the monthly subscription).

### 2\. Best price of unlimited cloud storage service

For the best **cloud storage prices** for unlimited storage, here is a list of a few recommended cloud storage services.

**#1\. Sync.com**

![sync.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-3.JPG)

The service offers one of the industry's most excellent versioning systems, broad file-sharing functionality, outstanding security, and privacy.

Sync.com offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:

* Teams Standard Plan for 1TB of storage space costs $6 per month, billed annually
* Teams Unlimited Plan for Unlimited storage space costs $15 per month, billed annually.
* Enterprise plan – Custom pricing

**#2\. Dropbox**

![dropbox](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-4.JPG)

It established numerous file-sharing and syncing trends currently refined. Dropbox first used the sync-folder model, and this version is among the finest.

Dropbox offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:

### 3\. Overall cheapest cloud storage service

You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.

**#1\. Sync.com**

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sync.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG)

Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.

**Pricing:** 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15

**#2\. IceDrive**

![icedrive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG)

IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.

**Pricing:** 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15

**#3\. Google Drive**

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![googledrive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG)

There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.

**Pricing**: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly

## Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?

**Cloud storage pricing** is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.

**1\. Authorities and Standards**

The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.

**2\. Locking of Cloud Data**

It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As **cloud storage prices** become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.

**3\. Access Cost and Speed**

Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers' service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.
