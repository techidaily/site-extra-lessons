 Drones or UAVs are designed with capabilities to fly in air without a pilot. Their movements are mainly controlled by a remote unit in most of the cases whereas few highly advanced designs are operated from computers.

 There are so many varieties of drones that you can easily find in world and all of them are working for different applications so we cannot define any set criteria for their classification. Depending upon the need or applications, they can have variable size and design.

 One of the most common applications of drone technology is in military as it helps to control surveillance related issues with ease. Places where humans cannot enter directly can be easily monitored by an air flying unit and it can also capture photographs of critical locations. Here we are going to discuss various types of drones and for ease of understating they are categorized into four basic sections: Numbers of propellers used inside, their size, flying range and equipments.

#### 2. Close Range Drones

 Such drones are able to fly up to 50 Km with a battery backup of 1 to 6 hours. As they can work for longer durations and can cover far distances so they find their applications in surveillance missions.

#### 3. Short Range Drones

 They are little superior as compared to close range drones so are commonly use for military applications. They are able to travel up to maximum distance of 150 Km that means coverage is almost 100Km more than that of close range drones. The estimated flight time for short range drones is 8 to 12 hours so they are useful for reconnaissance and spy applications.

#### 4. Mid Range Drones

 This category of drones is much powerful as compared to all discussed above. They are well known as high speed drones that can cover area up to 650 Km. Mid range drones are commonly used for surveillance applications and some basic type under this category work for meteorological data collection needs.

#### 5. Endurance

![endurance drone

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

 Drones or UAVs are designed with capabilities to fly in air without a pilot. Their movements are mainly controlled by a remote unit in most of the cases whereas few highly advanced designs are operated from computers.

 There are so many varieties of drones that you can easily find in world and all of them are working for different applications so we cannot define any set criteria for their classification. Depending upon the need or applications, they can have variable size and design.

 One of the most common applications of drone technology is in military as it helps to control surveillance related issues with ease. Places where humans cannot enter directly can be easily monitored by an air flying unit and it can also capture photographs of critical locations. Here we are going to discuss various types of drones and for ease of understating they are categorized into four basic sections: Numbers of propellers used inside, their size, flying range and equipments.

## Different types of Drones

| [Number of propellers](#propellers) | [Size](#size)      | [Range](#range) | [Equipment](#equip) |          |             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| **Rotory drone**                    | multi-rotor drones | Tricopter       | Very small          | Consumer | With camera |
| Quadcopter                          | Mini               | Prosumer        | With FPV            |          |             |
| Hexacopter                          | Medium             | Professinal     | With GPS            |          |             |
| Octocopter                          | Large              | /               | With stabilizers    |          |             |
| Single-rotor drones                 | /                  | /               | /                   | /        |             |
| **Fixed-wing drones**               | /                  | /               | /                   | /        | /           |

### Section 1: According to Number of Propellers

![drones type by propellers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/types-of-drones.png)

####

**Rotory drones**

#### 1. Single Rotor Drone

![single rotor drone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/single-rotor-drone.jpg)

 The most common construction in rotory type drone use to be multi rotor type designs that have many rotors for holding its position but in case if single rotor model you will find just a single rotor inside. Another one will be a tail rotor that simply assists to provide control to the heading. In case if you have a mixture of hover possessing heavy loads but need a faster flight time with longer endurance then single rotor type helicopters can be best choice for you.

#### 2. Tricopter

![tricopter drone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tricopter-drone.jpg)

 There are three different types of powerful motors inside a tricopter, three controllers, four gyros and only one servo. The motors are simply placed at every extreme end of three arms and each one of these is holding a location sensor. Whenever you need to lift your tricopter, it is essential to initiate a movement in throttle lever, the gyro sensor will immediately receive its signal and will pass is directly to controller that helps to control motor rotation. A tricopter is able to stay stabilized on its path as it is equipped with so many classic sensors and electronic stuff itself. You need not to apply any manual correction.

#### 3. Quadcopter

![quadcopter drone
](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quadcopter-drone.jpg)

 When a multirotor is designed with four rotor blades then it becomes quadcopter. These devices are usually controlled by specially designed brushless type DC motors. Two of the motors use to move in clockwise direction whereas other two run in counter clockwise direction. It helps to decide a safe landing for quadcopter. The source of battery for such devices uses to be a lithium polymer battery.

#### 4. Hexacopter

![hexacopter-drone
](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hexacopter-drone.jpg)

 Hexacopter will serve you for many potential applications with its 6 motor mechanism where 3 work on clockwise direction and other three move in anti clock wise direction. Hence, these devices are able to gain higher lifting power as compared to quadcopters. You need not to worry about its mechanism as it is designed to serve as an extremely safe landing craft.

#### 5. Octocopter

![octocopter-drones
](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/octocopter-drones.jpg
)

 Octo means eight; so octocopter is going to serve you with its powerful eight motors and that send power to 8 functional propellers. This craft naturally have much flying capabilities as compared to units discussed above and are also highly stable. You can avail a stable footage recording with octocopters at any altitude. These devices find application in the world of professional photography.

####

**Fixed Wing Drone**

![fixed wing drone
](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fixed-wing-drone.jpg
)

 Here is entirely different category from all above units. There designs are quite unique as compared to commonly used multi rotor type drones. You will find a wing on them and they appear like traditional airplanes. These drones are not able to stand stable in air as they are not much powerful to fight against gravitational force. They find their applications in movement related recording where they can move forward as per capabilities offers by their inbuilt battery system.

####

**The bottom line**

 Most of the designs of drones available in market are quadcopters because they are able to lift huge weight without any additional engineering adjustment. It is the most cost effective solution to most of your needs.
