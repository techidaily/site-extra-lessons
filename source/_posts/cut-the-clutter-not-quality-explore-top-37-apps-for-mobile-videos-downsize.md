If you created a funny video with your friends or caught a wonderful scene in nature, you may want to send the video to someone. Or maybe you want to upload it online. The problem is that some videos have a very large file size, which makes uploading or sending it to someone difficult. That is why you may need to **compress the video on Android** before you can send it out.

The good news is that you can easily use free applications on your Android phone to compress those videos. Then you can delete the original video, free up space on your phone, and send the video out to anyone you want! Here are six apps for compressing video on Android.

If you created a funny video with your friends or caught a wonderful scene in nature, you may want to send the video to someone. Or maybe you want to upload it online. The problem is that some videos have a very large file size, which makes uploading or sending it to someone difficult. That is why you may need to **compress the video on Android** before you can send it out.

The good news is that you can easily use free applications on your Android phone to compress those videos. Then you can delete the original video, free up space on your phone, and send the video out to anyone you want! Here are six apps for compressing video on Android.
