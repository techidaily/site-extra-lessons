That is about to change completely as Apple introduced the first Mac with a new <strong>Apple M1</strong> chip that uses ARM-64 bit architecture. It is Apple’s first custom silicon system on a chip that is being used in the new Macs. It was already being used in iPads and iPhones, and now it is being presented in the new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook mini.</p><h2 id="What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook"><a href="#What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?"></a>What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?</h2><p>The instruction set that is being used by the ARM technology is much more simplified than x86, thus, making it more energy-efficient. Up until today, Macs used Intel processors which had multiple chips for I&#x2F;O, processor, security, and memory. The M1 chip unlike the Intel processors has combined all these chips into a single system on chip or SoC. This makes it more simple, efficient, and better at performance.</p><p>M1 is also the first personal computer chip built with 5-nanometer process technology. Apple has managed to fit 16,000,000,000 transistors in a single M1 chip, which is more than any chip ever invented for personal computers.</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>The CPU consists of 8 cores with 4 of them being high-performance and four high-efficiency cores. These cores can work alone unless they are needed to do high-performance tasks, in which case all 8 cores can work together. This technology makes at least 3.9 times faster than its Intel counterpart and gives the MacBook an amazing 20-hour playback on battery time.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU</strong></li></ul><p>The GPU is an eight-core integrated chip with 2.6 teraflops of raw power output. The performance tests have revealed that running around 25,000 threads concurrently gives it a better performance than the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti.</p><p>Normally, PCs need a separate chip for graphics performance, but Apple’s new integrated GPU gives it a huge performance edge with minimum power consumption. According to apple, it is the world’s fastest integrated graphics in a PC.</p><ul><li><strong>Neural Engine</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s latest neural engine has a 16-core design which enables it to execute 11 trillion operations per second. This means that video editors can frame a click intelligently and instantly. Apart from that, the software can make the details better and sharper in no time. The new neural engine gives apple 15x faster machine learning capabilities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/apple-m1.jpg"                      alt="apple m1 chip"                ></p><h2 id="Apple-M1-compared-to-Intel-Processors"><a href="#Apple-M1-compared-to-Intel-Processors" class="headerlink" title="Apple M1 compared to Intel Processors"></a>Apple M1 compared to Intel Processors</h2><p>The new Apple M1 chip is proving to be better than its old Intel base models. Here are a few comparisons:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>Apple M1</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core-i7</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core-i9</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td>3.2 GHz</td><td>2.6 GHz</td><td>5.3 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cores</strong></td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turbo</strong> (1 Core)</td><td>None</td><td>5.10 GHz</td><td>5.00 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turbo</strong> (All Cores)</td><td></td><td>3.20 GHz</td><td>4.70 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Core Architecture</strong></td><td>Hybrid (big. LITTLE)</td><td>Normal</td><td>Normal</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Apple M1 VS Intel Core-i7</strong></li></ul><p>Apple M1 beats the Intel i7 speed by 2.8 times according to Apple. The graphics are significantly better and all that with the minimum usage of power. Apple claims that the battery can last up to 20 hours.</p><p>According to a test between the new Apple Macbook with M1 chip vs Dell XPS 13 with 11th gen core-i7, the M1 performed way better than i7. The first test was opening 50 apps simultaneously which apple won by a huge margin. While the M1 chip was able to open and run all the apps within a matter of seconds, the Dell XPS took its time to open those apps and once it did, they were unable to run. Apart from all that, the M1 fan was working efficiently and silently while Dell had overheated and almost hanged.</p><p>When it came to testing the battery life, after 4 hours of intense gaming the Dell had a 7% battery left. The Macbook with M1 was still running at 30%. In benchmark performances, on single-core The M1 was 7% faster yet on multiple cores, the M1 was a whopping 63% faster than i7.</p><p>There is also a $300 price difference between the two with Apple Macbook being the cheaper one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i7.png"                      alt="Intel i7"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Apple M1 VS Intel Core-i9</strong></li></ul><p>When it comes to specifications the i9 takes a little of upper-hand in performance, but they also come in much more expensive PCs. Now even with all that, the most surprising aspect was that on Geekbench 5, the Apple M1 still outperformed the i9 on single-core by 23%; however, on multiple cores, the i9 was 19% faster than the new M1.</p><p>Keeping all that in mind, the M1 might still need to catch-up to the i9, but it certainly poses a huge threat for Intel as this is just Apple’s first experiment. One factor that also makes the i9 perform better is that it allows up to 128 GB of memory while the M1 only comes with 8 GB and 16 GB variants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i9.png"                      alt="Intel i9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips"><a href="#What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips" class="headerlink" title="What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?"></a>What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?</h2><p>The new M1 chip is only available in a limited number of systems as of now and Apple will still be making its PCs using the Intel chip. You’ll now have the option to choose either the M1 variant or the one with an Intel processor. Apple will however move towards installing the M1 chip in all of its Macs if the experiment goes well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148641/16836" target="_top" id="2148641">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148641" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="254" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148641/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-the-M1-Chip-Good-for-Video-Editing"><a href="#Is-the-M1-Chip-Good-for-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Is the M1 Chip Good for Video Editing?"></a>Is the M1 Chip Good for Video Editing?</h2><p>Definitely yes! The performance of M1 Chip on video editing is quite impressive. It can edit multiple 4-8K videos smoothly, and the rendering is faster than Intel. What you can’t say no to it - it is truly efficient. After conducting several editing tasks, there is still plenty of battery life. The only flaw would be if the video editor does not run natively on the M1 chip, you would not experience that much difference.</p><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Which Video Editor Works on M1 Chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has launched the M1 technology that has broken all the barriers of innovation in the personal computer world. It has recently been launched only on MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook mini, but it is just a test phase which apple is nailing by the way.</p><p>This is the first integrated chip for a personal computer that combines I&#x2F;O, GPU, CPU, and memory together. Compared with its Intel counterparts, the M1 outperforms them by a huge margin. With 16 billion transistors and the highest CPU performance per watt, Apple has outdone itself with its new technology. Although it may have a few drawbacks it is quite new in the market and even in its initial phase, the M1 looks exceedingly promising.</p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to claim this achievement as the setting stone for a new world of technology when it comes to personal computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137218/26400" target="_top" id="2137218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137218/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-choosing-your-gopro-an-exhaustive-comparison/"><u>[New] Choosing Your GoPro An Exhaustive Comparison</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-deactivating-latest-os-restoring-to-mac-os-1010/"><u>[New] In 2024, Deactivating Latest OS Restoring to Mac OS 10.10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamline-your-videos-crop-and-export-tutorial-for-instagram/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamline Your Videos Crop & Export Tutorial for Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/fixing-locked-iphone-display-enable-rotation-between-portrait-and-landscape-modes/"><u>Fixing Locked Iphone Display: Enable Rotation Between Portrait and Landscape Modes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-aerial-mastery-with-husqvarna-h501x4-fpv-analysis/"><u>In 2024, Aerial Mastery with Husqvarna H501X4 FPV Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-youtube-screen-recording/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/innovative-approaches-for-podcast-cover-art-mastery/"><u>Innovative Approaches for Podcast Cover Art Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-best-steadicam-options-for-high-end-dslr-video-production/"><u>The Best Steadicam Options for High-End DSLR Video Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/top-video-montages-on-mobile-devices-a-8-must-have-list/"><u>Top Video Montages on Mobile Devices A 8 Must-Have List</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This 8K OLED Smart TV runs on the WebOS, enables you to browse the Internet effortlessly and it offers point, click, scroll and voice remote control options.</p><p>The sound system that comes with this high-end television set is as impressive as all of its other features, but the hefty price tag and limited warranty make LG Signature Z9 88-inch Class 8K Smart OLED TV available only to a small circle of TV enthusiast.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1542129%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1542129/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Samsung-75’’-Class-Q900"><a href="#3-Samsung-75’’-Class-Q900" class="headerlink" title="3.

The Q900’s Quantum Processor 8K is less powerful than those you can find on pricier 8K UHD TVs, while its Quantum HDR 32X isn’t as wide as you could expect from a high-end television set such as this Samsung’s 8K model.</p><p>Even so, the Dynamic Black Equalizer and the FreeSync™ technology make Samsung Q900 a perfect choice for all gamers. Moreover, the ultra-viewing angle panel guarantees that colors are equally vibrant regardless of the angle from which you view them.</p><p>Samsung’s 8K QLED TV set features the Intelligent Mode that automatically matches the image brightness and the sound level to the room conditions. The 8K AI upscaling feature enhances 4K or HD visual content and maximizes its quality. Besides the remarkable picture quality, the Samsung Class Q900 8K Smart TV also features the Decoration Mode that enables you to display photos.

The IGZO displays are capable of displaying images that have up to 33 million pixels and depict colors accurately, just as nature intended them to be. The wide color gamut ensures realistic color depiction and creates an enhanced feeling of depth in all images displayed on Sharp Aquos 8K TVs.</p><p>Furthermore, the high-transmittance liquid crystal technology is empowered by a wide dynamic range so that all images are bright and vibrant.</p><p>The 8K AI Revelation image processing engine possesses stunning processing capacity and it can upscale all lower resolution content to the 8K image quality. In addition, the Sharp Aquos 8K TVs are equipped with the AI that reduces noise in images and reconstructs information that is lost during the upscaling process.

However, there is no doubt that the quality of the images and sound 8K TV sets can reproduce surpasses that of most powerful Full HD and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The <strong>size of the TV’s display</strong> is the first and probably the most crucial factor you should consider before you choose to purchase an 8K TV. The difference in the picture quality between 4K and 8K television sets isn’t that obvious if the diagonal of the display is relatively short. The vast majority of the 8K TV models have <strong>diagonals that range from 60 to 100 inches.</strong> The quality of the details becomes more visible as the size of the TV increases, which is why you shouldn’t choose 8K TV models that have diagonals that are shorter than 80 inches.</p><p>Besides the size, you should also pay close attention to the TV’s <strong>image processing capabilities</strong>, its <strong>dynamic range,</strong> and the <strong>upscaling options.</strong> The dynamic range guarantees that the contrast between the darkest and brightest areas of the screen is going to be perfectly balanced, which enables you to see objects that are in the shadows clearly.</p><p>Moreover, the accuracy with which the 8K TV depicts colors depends on its image processing capacity, so you must make sure that the model you are considering can display realistic colors even when playing demanding visual content.</p><p>The 8K upscaling options are particularly important because finding the videos or video games in 8K resolution is still difficult, and TV’s upscaling potential can bring out the most of the visual content in lower resolutions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-Buying-an-8K-TV-a-Good-Investment-in-2024"><a href="#Is-Buying-an-8K-TV-a-Good-Investment-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Is Buying an 8K TV a Good Investment in 2024?"></a>Is Buying an 8K TV a Good Investment in 2024?</h3><p>Despite being commercially available, 8K TVs are still excruciatingly expensive. Their price is hardly justified because the content in 8K resolution isn’t easy to come by. Currently, only a handful of professional video cameras offer the option to capture footage in this resolution, and most TV and movie productions have been slow in adopting the 8K resolution.</p><p>Professional cinematographers and video editors who need to process the footage captured in 8K resolution can benefit from purchasing an 8K TV set or monitor because it will enable them to see how the material they are editing is going to look like.</p><p>However, it is too early for most homeowners to jump on the 8K train because it still isn’t clear if the movie and TV stations are going to make the switch to the 8K resolution in the near future. Until the 8K resolution becomes the industry standard, it is better to stick to 4K television sets simply because there is more content available.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The hyper-realistic images 8K TVs can reproduce would leave anyone breathless, as the level of detail they depict is unprecedented. Nonetheless, the 8K technology is still developing, and at this point, it is hard to say if it will become the industry standard in the foreseeable future. The selection of 8K TV models is going to remain as scarce in 2024 as it was in the previous years, so it may be a good idea to postpone buying of a new 8K TV until more models become available on the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/-easy-steps-for-a-subscriber-surge-on-youtube/"><u>[New] 7 Easy Steps for a Subscriber Surge on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-covert-creation-of-personal-snaps-on-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] The Covert Creation of Personal Snaps on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-ios-system-of-iphone-12-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Repair iOS System of iPhone 12 Pro Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-samsung-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Car Locator Apps for Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/laughs-in-a-click-building-hilarious-memes/"><u>Laughs in a Click Building Hilarious Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/revolutionary-drone-editing-for-visual-storytellers/"><u>Revolutionary Drone Editing for Visual Storytellers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/snap-into-action-a-compelling-ig-gallery-of-inspiration/"><u>Snap Into Action!

You will be glad to know that these standard batteries can be easily used for multi rotors, helis, planes, boats and R&#x2F;C cars. If you are searching for a good quality battery for your drone then the guide below can assist you to follow right directions for selection. There are so many specifications and features related to LiPo batteries that you need to consider while buying a new one.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to choose the best LiPo battery</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best Battery Brands For UAV to Consider</a></li></ul><h2 id="Tips-on-How-to-Choose-the-Best-LiPo-Battery-for-Your-Drone"><a href="#Tips-on-How-to-Choose-the-Best-LiPo-Battery-for-Your-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Tips on How to Choose the Best LiPo Battery for Your Drone"></a>Tips on How to Choose the Best LiPo Battery for Your Drone</h2><h4 id="1-Battery-Size"><a href="#1-Battery-Size" class="headerlink" title="1. Battery Size"></a>1. Battery Size</h4><p> Battery size is an important parameter for great flight experience. Prefer to pick a larger one in terms of capacity so that it can serve your drone for longer duration. Ability of a battery to allow maximum flight time in air also depends upon overall weight of the drone as with larger physical size, even a highly powerful battery will face some reduction in flight time. Physical size of battery will be considered on the basis of drone type and its battery cabinet. Before buying a new battery for your camera, prefer to check your drone specifications.</p><h4 id="2-Battery-Voltage"><a href="#2-Battery-Voltage" class="headerlink" title="2. Battery Voltage"></a>2. Battery Voltage</h4><p> Battery voltage is also termed as cell count and it is an important parameter for your investment. If you have batteries with higher voltage rating then it will naturally help your drone motors to produce higher power. But at the same time high voltage batteries use to have more weight hence it will directly increase overall weight of your drone.</p><p> Actually you need not to follow any golden rule for battery voltage selection but you can make decisions via comparing data tables as well as efficiency. Most of you might have observed that drone motors usually become much powerful and efficient when they are powered by higher voltage. But the disadvantage for which you have to make proper adjustments is the problem with cost and weight of battery. If you are able to make decision about how much motors your device will be using then you can also decide about required current set up.</p><p> Here is an important thing to note that if you are going to buy new batteries then always prefer to get a product whose specifications are suitable with need of specific voltage or current rating. There are few motors that follow very specific rating for voltage and current of LiPo batteries, hence you need to make proper decision for your investment.</p><h4 id="3-Connectors"><a href="#3-Connectors" class="headerlink" title="3. Connectors"></a>3. Connectors</h4><p> Connectors are important part of your drone batteries; they not only provide you easy way to connect or disconnect batteries form devices rather they also help users to create new drones in future. You can easily find so many varieties of connectors in market but one needs to pay more attention while making selection for any of these as they must be compatible enough with your drone type. However, buyers can often pick a connector of their choice and stick to it till for better performance. Some of the most common connector products use Deans&#x2F;Tplugs, EC3 and XT60 connectors with unique specifications. Collect some information about your device compatibility and get a suitable product with right specifications.</p><h4 id="4-Discharge-Rate"><a href="#4-Discharge-Rate" class="headerlink" title="4. Discharge Rate"></a>4. Discharge Rate</h4><p><strong>What is it:</strong></p><p> Discharge rate of a battery is well known as it C rating. This rating helps users to know about the maximum current that a battery can discharge but without damaging itself. Although, these figures often use to be unrealistic but still they are considered good for quality measurement. For example, if you are going to buy new batteries and any brand offers them with 45C and 65C rating then you must prefer to pick 65C model as it has ability to handle much higher discharge rate as compared to the 45C model.</p><p> <strong>How does it affect?</strong></p><p> Many people are unaware of the fact that overall performance of a drone is highly dependent on its Discharge C rating. Professionals always prefer to pick their batteries after checking this specific rating. 9 out of 10 experts suggest choosing those batteries that have maximum C discharge rating.</p><p> Here you need to know one thing that if you install a battery that has higher discharge rate then your drone will definitely become much heavier as much weight of battery unit will be added up. Ultimately, the overall flight time of your drone gets reduced.</p><p> It could appear difficult task to most of drone users and they may need professional assistance for selection of right batteries. While buying a new battery unit, first if all prefer to check the specifications of your motors and also check their maximum current rating. Here is a simple law that can help you to perform right calculation: Generally:</p><p> Maximum Continuous Amp Draw &#x3D; Battery Capacity X Discharge Rate.</p><h4 id="5-Battery-Capacity"><a href="#5-Battery-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="5. Battery Capacity"></a>5. Battery Capacity</h4><p><strong>What is it</strong></p><p> This number helps users to know about how long a battery can supply power to certain device. It is indicated by mAh rating that stands for “milli amp hours”- that means how much milli amps this battery can supply you for one hour. If you want to know about the time for which your drone can fly in air with a particular batter unit then simply device its mAh rating with average current that is drown in amps rating and finally divide its answer by 1000. This calculation will help users to make a approximate idea about how long their drone can stay in air or how long your battery can supply power to connected drone unit. But to complete this calculation you must know the current rating of your miniquad. Prefer to check its specification list to collect information about current rating of device.</p><p> If you have a mini-quad then you might have noticed that its battery often range somewhere between 1000 mAh and 1800 mAh and 1300 mAh use to be the most preferable size. It offers impressive balance between weight and power capability. Here is one more interesting thing to know that capacity of battery also helps to know about its ability to produce Amps and it also indicate the maximum time for which batter can serve without getting completely discharged.</p><p><strong>How to select?</strong></p><p> Professionals suggest that one must buy a battery with highest capacity as it can ensure longer flight time. But while making selection for a new battery for your drone always prefer to pick a size as per specification of your device. Its weight should not exceed from the range that your drone cannot lift. Pick a trustworthy manufacturer that ensures right specifications and standard design.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Battery-Brands-for-UAV-to-consider"><a href="#Best-Battery-Brands-for-UAV-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Best Battery Brands for UAV to consider"></a>Best Battery Brands for UAV to consider</h2><ul><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://hobbyking.com/en%5Fus/batteries/lipoly-all-brands.html" >Hobbyking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong><br> Hobbyking is rated as one of the most useful source of high quality batteries and you can buy in large stock from this company.

These are images where you shoot your subjects from a bird’s eye view. In addition, your subjects need to be in a systematic order to prevent any confusion in your target audience. For example, you can arrange your photography equipment on a table to show the diversity required to shoot photographs.</p><p>Typically, cool photos on pexels.com under the flat lay keyword feature inanimate subjects such as food and equipment. Furthermore, flat lay stock photos are the best choice for social media posts on Twitter and Instagram.

Camera shake is a huge distraction and, if it is a persistent problem in your YouTube videos, it will be hard to get subscribers. Shakiness is an easy problem to correct. With a bit of equipment, or a bit of creativity, it is easy to make sure your YouTube videos are nice and smooth.</p><h2 id="Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube"><a href="#Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube</h2><p>This article will talk about different types of equipment you can use to stabilize your camera. For vloggers on a budget, there is even one tip on stabilizing your camera without camera equipment. Here are some of the best stabilizers for YouTube videos:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Tripod"><a href="#1-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="1. Tripod"></a>1. Tripod</h3><p>A tripod is a three-legged stand you can mount your camera to. The height of a tripod can be adjusted so you can set your camera up at the level that works best for you. Because tripods can stand alone you can set your camera up to record yourself without needing a helper.</p><p>Tripods are the best choice for vlogs that revolve around you standing (or sitting) and delivering information, like opinion or beauty vlogs.</p><h3 id="2-Monopod"><a href="#2-Monopod" class="headerlink" title="2. Monopod"></a>2. Monopod</h3><p>A monopod is like a tripod in the sense that you can adjust its height, but unlike a tripod a monopod has only one leg and cannot stand by itself. You will need a helper to stay with your camera if you plan to film yourself using a monopod. A monopod is more portable than a tripod, though, and can be used in a wider variety of places. You can even use a monopod to record aerial shots just by picking it up.</p><h3 id="3-Pistol-Grip"><a href="#3-Pistol-Grip" class="headerlink" title="3. Pistol Grip"></a>3. Pistol Grip</h3><p>A pistol grip is a handle you mount your camera to the top of. You can carry your camera around on top of the pistol grip, or you can mount the grip itself to your tripod or monopod. Once the grip is mounted you can use it to more easily control your camera movements. This is a great way to get even, steady, camera pans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044582/7443" target="_top" id="2044582">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044582" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044582/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Selfie-Stick"><a href="#4-Selfie-Stick" class="headerlink" title="4. Selfie Stick"></a>4. Selfie Stick</h3><p>A selfie stick is a long pole you mount your smartphone to one end of in order to take selfies from farther away. Selfie sticks also make great stabilizers if you are shooting video on your smartphone. To stabilize your smartphone place the handle of your selfie stick on the ground as if it were a monopod. When you are shooting using a selfie stick you can also hold it up in the air to get interesting high angle shots.</p><p>Some YouTubers even like to shoot selfie-style vlogs where the hold the selfie stick just like they are taking a photo of themselves.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization"></a>5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization</h3><p>‘Optical Image Stabilization’ is fairly new hardware which is built in to a lot of new smartphones, like the iPhone 6S Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. OIS reduces camera shake by a lot, although it is still a good idea to stabilize your smartphone while you record. OIS will also help you take sharper still photos without using any software.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139117/17108" target="_top" id="2139117">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139117" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139117/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect"><a href="#6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect" class="headerlink" title="6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect"></a>6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect</h3><p>If you do not have equipment, or cannot bring it where you want to shoot, then you can still record steady footage. You just have to get creative with where you put your camera. Any stable surface will do. You can set your camera down on a shelf in your house, a picnic bench, or up in a tree.</p><p>If you are able to lean your elbows onto a desk or table while you hold your camera then that will also significantly cut down on camera shake. This works best for footage you are not in, or which you can have a helper film for you. If you are open to shooting a selfie-style vlog then you can use anything you can rest your hand on, like a fence or a railing.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-learn-to-craft-eye-catching-youtube-thumbnails-using-your-phone/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Learn to Craft Eye-Catching YouTube Thumbnails Using Your Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-best-ff-browser-add-ons-for-fb-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best FF Browser Add-Ons for FB Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-bridging-audio-artistry-in-visual-formats/"><u>[New] Bridging Audio Artistry in Visual Formats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-best-practices-for-safe-no-cost-vlc-player-download-on-apple-systems/"><u>[Updated] Best Practices for Safe, No-Cost VLC Player Download on Apple Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-canvascartoons-detailed-scrutiny-and-handbooks-24/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, CanvasCartoons Detailed Scrutiny & Handbooks '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-obs-setup-for-zoom-streaming-excellence/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating OBS Setup for Zoom Streaming Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-fastest-mobile-apps-for-speeding-up-sound-tracks/"><u>2024 Approved Fastest Mobile Apps for Speeding Up Sound Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-hustle-free-download-free-gif-conversion-tools-ranked/"><u>2024 Approved Hustle-Free, Download-Free GIF Conversion Tools Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/android-screen-stuck-general-honor-x7b-partly-screen-unresponsive-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Android Screen Stuck General Honor X7b Partly Screen Unresponsive | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/free-range-creativity-with-premium-ae-samples/"><u>Free-Range Creativity with Premium AE Samples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-aerial-mastery-with-husqvarna-h501x4-fpv-analysis/"><u>In 2024, Aerial Mastery with Husqvarna H501X4 FPV Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/incorporating-multimedia-in-school-curricula/"><u>Incorporating Multimedia in School Curricula</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/innovative-approaches-for-podcast-cover-art-mastery/"><u>Innovative Approaches for Podcast Cover Art Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/mellow-melodies-gradual-audio-decline-in-garageband/"><u>Mellow Melodies Gradual Audio Decline in Garageband</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mov-files-are-unwatchable-on-g54-5g-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mov-on-android/"><u>MOV files are unwatchable on G54 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-video-editing-dilemma-final-cut-pro-or-lumafusion-weve-got-the-answer/"><u>New 2024 Approved Video Editing Dilemma?

In layman terms, audio crossfades duration refers to the amount of time a Media Player needs to fade out one music before fading in the next. In the Crossfade editor, you may change the default crossfades length and form. If you’re looking to kickstart your audio editing journey with the audio cross fade as a part of it? Refer to the upcoming sections to learn that hassle-free.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">What is Fade</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">What is Crossfade</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Crossfade Audio</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Crossfade audio on Smartphone</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-1">Crossfade Audio on Computer</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-Audio-Fade-Vs-Crossfade"><a href="#Part-1-Audio-Fade-Vs-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You may gradually raise or lower the level of audio events or audio clips by using fade ins and fade outs. Event-based or clip-based fade ins and fade outs are also possible. In this situation, the fade feature in a sequencer or audio editor may often be utilized swiftly and efficiently.</p><p>A video transition is comparable to an audio fade. There is often a sweet spot when the fading truly disappears. You often have a choice of fade curves with fade functions. Using the faders on a mixer, whether it be hardware or software, is the most natural method to fade. All current software sequencers will capture your motions, allowing you to modify, fade, and tune until you find the perfect rhythm. Keep fade-ins brief in most situations unless you’re going for a specific impact.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151888/7443" target="_top" id="2151888">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151888" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151888/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="What is Crossfade?"></a>What is Crossfade?</h3><p>Adding an audio transition between two adjacent audio clips on the same track creates a crossfade. You may apply a crossfade transition to either end of a single clip to have it fade in or fade out. A crossfade is the technique of fading one piece of audio out while also fading the other one in, unlike a fade, which is conducted on only one piece of audio. The sound engine’s maximum crossfade time when switching from Sound A to Sound B is equal to half the duration of Audio File A.</p><p>You may use crossfades to provide seamless transitions between several audio events on the same track. Crossfading is always depending on events. You may manually carry out a crossfade, just as with fades. The two songs’ blended versions must be routed to two distinct sets of faders. Only when the subsequent events or their corresponding clips overlap can crossfades be made. This is typically used in recording to make one track on an album fade into or blend with the next. When done well, it has a fantastic impact.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio"></a>Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio</h2><p>Because a crossfade requires a bit more work than a fade, it’s important to consider the assistance your sequencer or audio editor may provide. Most include a crossfade feature, and some, once more, give users a choice of curvature. Additionally, you may be able to utilize one fade-in curve and a second one for the fade-out.</p><h3 id="1-Crossfade-audio-on-Smartphone"><a href="#1-Crossfade-audio-on-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="1.

You may gradually raise or lower the level of audio events or audio clips by using fade ins and fade outs. Event-based or clip-based fade ins and fade outs are also possible. In this situation, the fade feature in a sequencer or audio editor may often be utilized swiftly and efficiently.</p><p>A video transition is comparable to an audio fade. There is often a sweet spot when the fading truly disappears. You often have a choice of fade curves with fade functions. Using the faders on a mixer, whether it be hardware or software, is the most natural method to fade. All current software sequencers will capture your motions, allowing you to modify, fade, and tune until you find the perfect rhythm. Keep fade-ins brief in most situations unless you’re going for a specific impact.</p><h3 id="What-is-Crossfade-1"><a href="#What-is-Crossfade-1" class="headerlink" title="What is Crossfade?"></a>What is Crossfade?</h3><p>Adding an audio transition between two adjacent audio clips on the same track creates a crossfade. You may apply a crossfade transition to either end of a single clip to have it fade in or fade out. A crossfade is the technique of fading one piece of audio out while also fading the other one in, unlike a fade, which is conducted on only one piece of audio. The sound engine’s maximum crossfade time when switching from Sound A to Sound B is equal to half the duration of Audio File A.</p><p>You may use crossfades to provide seamless transitions between several audio events on the same track. Crossfading is always depending on events. You may manually carry out a crossfade, just as with fades. The two songs’ blended versions must be routed to two distinct sets of faders. Only when the subsequent events or their corresponding clips overlap can crossfades be made. This is typically used in recording to make one track on an album fade into or blend with the next. When done well, it has a fantastic impact.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio"></a>Part 2.

Imagine it like Sketch or Photoshop for augmented reality. The color values of the camera texture are mapped to the x, y, and z coordinates of the location in the color LUT. This location contains a corresponding output color that is drawn over the scene to create a color gradient effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-use-luts-in-spark-ar-1.jpg"                      alt="create a color gradient effect"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-LUTs-in-Spark-AR"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-LUTs-in-Spark-AR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It was a poor Frost Zombie in this instance. Since this is one of my simpler filters, I felt it was okay to publish the build information. Four objects make up much of the scene: an EyeColor block, a custom canvas segmentation, a face mesh, and an emitter for the breath mist (my personal favorite). To show the layers used in generating the primary zombie texture, I also moved to Substance Painter. This is a demonstration of my methods rather than a step-by-step manual.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-use-luts-in-spark-ar-4.jpg"                      alt="frost zombie"                ></p><h3 id="2-Fur"><a href="#2-Fur" class="headerlink" title="2.

I’ll explain how the screen tap computation procedure relates to texture position in this walkthrough. If you want to apply this approach and texture sequence in your projects or give it a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-use-luts-in-spark-ar-6.jpg"                      alt="shockwave"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134492/18498" target="_top" id="2134492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134492/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Transition-Curves"><a href="#4-Transition-Curves" class="headerlink" title="4. Transition Curves"></a>4. Transition Curves</h3><p>There are 11 distinct animation curves included with Spark AR in the Transition patch. Here is a helpful visual aid because it might be challenging to distinguish between a quartic and a quintic when working on a project. With the SDF circle doubled (to sharpen the edge) and inserted into the Patch Pack’s alpha channel, the circles are likewise straightforward rectangles. Since RGB values are three times one, the object is white.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-use-luts-in-spark-ar-7.jpg"                      alt="transition curves"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105883/7443" target="_top" id="2105883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Realistic-Smoke"><a href="#5-Realistic-Smoke" class="headerlink" title="5. Realistic Smoke"></a>5. Realistic Smoke</h3><p>By adding smoke to a scene, you can easily add a lot of detail and realism. Nothing revolutionary is happening here. The particle emitter creates flat planes of smoke texture that are forced upward. The force slowly shifts left and right as seen in the patch editor. The Fade particle script (created by Josh Beckwith) enlarges the particles and fades them out at the same time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-use-luts-in-spark-ar-8.jpg"                      alt="realistic smoke"                ></p><h3 id="6-Rainbow-Glitter"><a href="#6-Rainbow-Glitter" class="headerlink" title="6. Rainbow Glitter"></a>6. Rainbow Glitter</h3><p>Given how beautifully Glitter Rain was received, I believed it would be fitting to broaden the potential with an HDR setting. While Glitter Rain made use of two different colors, this technique makes use of an entirely colorless substance and gets its color information via HDR.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-use-luts-in-spark-ar-9.jpg"                      alt="rainbow glitter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037335/7443" target="_top" id="2037335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037335/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Closing-Thoughts"><a href="#Closing-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Closing Thoughts"></a>Closing Thoughts</h3><p>Spark AR is an amazing website for LUTs and color grading.

The resources utilized to express a story and convey a message include films, photography, animation, and music. These stories may distribute more widely and swiftly than ever through online platforms like webpages, journals, and social media sharing sites.</p><p><strong><em>“Simply put, it is telling stories with digital technologies. Digital stories are narratives built from the stuff of cyberculture.”</em></strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/keeping%5Fup%5Fwith/storytelling#:~:text=It%20involves%20creating%20and%20sharing,telling%20stories%20with%20digital%20technologies." >-Bryan Alexander. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Additionally, digital storytelling can include a variety of digital narratives. A rising number of businesses are taking note and investigating the potential applications of a digital story. It is frequently employed to refer to filmmaking in general, and it has recently been used to describe commercial and non-profit advertising and promotion efforts.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Development-of-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#Part-II-Development-of-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>Dana Atchley and Joe Lambert of the Center for Digital Storytelling started the digital storytelling advancement in 1994 by teaching others how to create digital stories. Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use. There were no devices for accessing the internet, and most individuals read the digital narrative on their desktop computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tools-and-tips-virtual-storytelling-2.jpg"                      alt="tools and tips for virtual storytelling"                ></p><p>In this regard, the Center for Digital Storytelling developed a digital story that emphasized first-person narratives that framed memories as potent stories using visuals, audio, and music. The capacity to add graphics and narration to stories gives them a unique significance for both the author and the audience of virtual storytelling.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Power-of-Digital-Storytelling-Compared-to-Traditional-Storytelling"><a href="#Power-of-Digital-Storytelling-Compared-to-Traditional-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Power of Digital Storytelling Compared to Traditional Storytelling"></a>Power of Digital Storytelling Compared to Traditional Storytelling</h3><p>Compared to traditional storytelling, digital storytelling is far more integrative and incorporates non-linguistic factors that give rise to new narratives.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="icon note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Click <a class="link"   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/how-to-use-the-azure-cognitive-services-net-speech-sdk-for-recognition" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a detailed guide on how to use Azure Speech Services with Visual Basic (SDK).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027167/19272" target="_top" id="2027167">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027167" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027167/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?</h2><p>We should all agree that using Microsoft Azures Speech Service is not a walk in the park. You need some knowledge of programming and Windows Command Prompt. Even worse, you’ll have to pay each time you want to convert speech to text after depleting the free credits.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of free speech to text converters for beginners. So, in this part, we’ll discuss some free Microsoft Azure STT alternatives for beginners.</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s a video editor for creating award-winning videos without prior editing skills. Just upload your local video and edit it as you please. And yes, it works with a host of video formats.</p><p>When you want to make perfect videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos"><a href="#Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora To Make STT videos"></a>Use Filmora To Make STT videos</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text. It’s that simple!</p><h3 id="3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee"><a href="#3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee" class="headerlink" title="3.Audtext - $60 one-time fee"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://audext.com/" >Audtext <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - $60 one-time fee</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-7.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text alternative audtext"                ></p><p>If Google’s voice recognition service is too slow for your liking, consider Audtext. It’s a highly rated online program that uses cutting-edge machine learning technology to transcribe audio to text in 60+ languages. You can easily train this program to identify the speaker in your interview or podcast file.</p><p>Meanwhile, Audtext can transcribe typical video and audio formats, including MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, and more. And after transcribing audio to text, exploit the inbuilt text editor to retouch and make your text presentable.</p><p>Let’s find out how this STT service works:</p><p>Step1Create a transcription account on Audtext and click New Upload to choose the transcription mode. You can select the automatic transcription that uses AI or professional real-human transcription. So, let’s choose Automatic.</p><p>Step2Drag-n-drop your video or audio file on the program and then choose the transcription language. After adding your file, click Upload to scan and transcribe it.

Today, you can use  VP9, AV1 and other codecs on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, Vimeo, and more. However, video codecs differ regarding file size, licensing, quality, and more. Now this brings us to the exciting <strong>AV1 vs VP9</strong> comparison. These two are currently some of the most widely used video codecs, especially on YouTube. So, which one should you use? Should you stick to the trusted VP9 or the brand-new AV1? This article helps you make the critical choice.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-VP9"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-VP9" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is VP9?"></a>Part 1. What is VP9?</h2><p>Released in 2013 by Google, VP9 is a free, open-source video codec that replaced VP8. This compression algorithm was released to compete with  a licensed video codec. VP9 enjoys broad support among modern HTML5 web browsers. In fact, VP9 has been compatible with Android since version 4.4 KitKat. This codec is also compatible with iOS&#x2F;iPadOS 14 or newer.</p><p>In the meantime, a 2014 comparison between VP9 and &#x2F;AVC discovered that VP9 offers a 45% bitrate advantage over. Netflix also concluded in 2016 that VP9  could have the same efficiency after tweaking the parameters. So overall, VP9 supports lossless encoding of raw bitstreams, making it perfect for streaming videos in MP4 and WebM.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-AV1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is AV1?"></a>Part 2. What is AV1?</h2><p>AV1 is a relatively new video codec by Alliance for Open Media, a consortium of which Google is a co-founder. Like VP9, it’s a royalty-free video codec, meaning you don’t have to pay licensing fee to use it. AV1 was developed to replace VP9, so expect it to be compatible with all VP9-supported platforms. Besides Google, the Alliance for Open Media also includes Netflix, Amazon, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla.</p><p>The first AV1 version was released in 2016 but was held back due to unresolved critical bugs. Then in March 2018, the Alliance announced another release alongside software encoder&#x2F;decoder. Although the codec is primarily designed to compete with licensed codecs like  AVC, there are concerns that it may threaten the existence of other royalty-free codecs. But as a consumer, freebies are always a welcome addition.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Detailed-Comparison-Between-VP9-and-AV1"><a href="#Part-3-Detailed-Comparison-Between-VP9-and-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Detailed Comparison Between VP9 and AV1"></a>Part 3. Detailed Comparison Between VP9 and AV1</h2><p>For viewers to enjoy high-quality content without using a lot of resources, efficient video compression technology is a must. As it stands, both VP9 and AV1 are royalty-free codecs, meaning that they are 100% free to use. However, these codecs differ. Here is what we’ve gathered for the <strong>VP9 vs AV1</strong> comparison:</p><h3 id="Compatibility-VP9-has-an-edge"><a href="#Compatibility-VP9-has-an-edge" class="headerlink" title="Compatibility - VP9 has an edge"></a>Compatibility - VP9 has an edge</h3><p>Both video compression techniques are relatively new, which AV1 being the latest. This means VP9 and AV1 are compatible with various HTML5 browsers and devices. Google says VP9 decoding is compatible with more than 2 billion endpoints, meaning you can open VP9 on Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Android smartphones&#x2F;TVs, and local media players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-1.jpg"                      alt="compatibility"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139120/17108" target="_top" id="2139120">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139120" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139120/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>But on the other hand, viewers might experience an “error” message when opening AV1 locally on your old PC. While Intel works around the clock to develop supported drivers, some may not be compatible with your old computer. But expect wider AV1 compatibility now that more tech companies like Meta, Samsung, and Apple have joined the Alliance for Open Media. Currently, YouTube and Netflix are already streaming some videos in AV1.</p><h3 id="Performance-AV1-has-an-edge"><a href="#Performance-AV1-has-an-edge" class="headerlink" title="Performance - AV1 has an edge"></a>Performance - AV1 has an edge</h3><p>Regarding practical performance, it’s widely agreed that AV1 has the upper hand over standard codecs like VP9, and VP8. According to a test by EpsosVox on Intel’s AV1 encoder, the codec showed higher performance efficiency than NVIDIA’s NVENC, OBS x264, and AMF by AMD. The test results showed that the AV1 encoder is 16% better than the competing encoders.</p><p>Another 2018 Facebook Engineering (now Meta) test showed that AV1 achieved 34% higher compression than VP9. The test also showed that AV1 is 50.3% and 46.2% better than the x264 main profile and x264 high profile. However, the test showed that AV1 requires a longer encoding duration than the current alternative due to the complexities involved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-2.jpg"                      alt="facebook av1 vs vp9 comparison"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Most importantly, Facebook suggested that AV1’s performance significantly increases with increased video resolution. This means viewers will enjoy a higher quality 8K and UHD&#x2F;4K content when using AV1 than VP9 and other codecs. And yes, higher compressions by AV1 mean a smaller file size at the same bitrates as the VP9 codec.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Into-the-Future-AV1-is-the-Trend"><a href="#Into-the-Future-AV1-is-the-Trend" class="headerlink" title="Into the Future - AV1 is the Trend"></a>Into the Future - AV1 is the Trend</h3><p>You probably know that AV1 comes from VP9 and is having difficulties in widespread use due to longer decoding times. But things are different now.</p><p>In the year of 2022, AV1 hardware encoder made amazing progress in supports from graphics card manufacturers—August, Intel’s new Arc Alchemist GPUs integrates with AV1 encoding and the Intel Arc AV1 Encoder Easily Beats AMD and Nvidia.</p><p>YouTube Video: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LznXh5lkgB0" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LznXh5lkgB0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Soon in the September, NVIDIA unveiled the GeForce RTX® 40 Series of GPUs, which comes with Dual NVIDIA Encoders (NVENC) that is able to “cut export times by up to half and feature AV1 support”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-3.jpg"                      alt="cut export times"                ></p><p>Let alone AV2 is upcoming in 3-5 years.
