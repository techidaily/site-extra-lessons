    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Configuring-Zoom-Step-by-Step-Video-Conference-Guide"><a href="#Configuring-Zoom-Step-by-Step-Video-Conference-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Zoom: Step-by-Step Video Conference Guide"></a>Configuring Zoom: Step-by-Step Video Conference Guide</h2><p>A few weeks ago, I saw an ad for Zoom in the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris while making a transfer from Lisbon Portugal. The first thing I thought about was how much money Zoom must be making. Even before the pandemic, Zoom was becoming a market leader in a way that GoToMeeting was previously – primarily from their awesome ease of use.</p><p>Heck, “Zoom” has even become a modern verb, as in, “Hey, let’s jump on a Zoom!”</p><p>One of the recent changes with Zoom is that videos being recorded are now announced as such when you come into the room for privacy reasons. It’s good practice to record all your Zoom meetings. I’ve been able to get testimonials from my clients by recording Zooms.</p><p>Video quality is important because you only get one chance. The source you record with cannot be upgraded in terms of quality. So, if your initial recording is poor, you’re going to be stuck with a subpar recording.</p><p>When recording, think about both your video quality, and the other Zoom participants you might want to record.</p><p>We all know and use Zoom, but there are some tricks you can use to make your videos look even better. Here are some simple tips to get a better-quality video recording from Zoom.</p><h2 id="Turn-on-HD"><a href="#Turn-on-HD" class="headerlink" title="Turn on HD"></a>Turn on HD</h2><p>HD video is disabled in Zoom by default. Obviously, HD requires more bandwidth and online space, so it’s easy to see why this is not enabled by default. So if you have not, be sure to enable HD video.</p><p>You can do that under Preferences -&gt; video. There is a button to toggle on HD. Toggle it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/turn-on-hd-camera-zoom.jpg"                      alt="turn on hd camera zoom"                ></p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: periodically check that this has not been disabled when you update to new versions of Zoom.</p><h2 id="Touch-up-Your-Appearance"><a href="#Touch-up-Your-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Touch up Your Appearance"></a>Touch up Your Appearance</h2><p>Next, under “My Video” click “touch up my appearance.” This will add a slider you can adjust to get the best picture quality. You will see your webcam in real time adjust as you toggle and play with these features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/touch-up-my-appearance-zoom.jpg"                      alt="touch up my appearance zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Adjust-for-Low-Light"><a href="#Adjust-for-Low-Light" class="headerlink" title="Adjust for Low Light"></a>Adjust for Low Light</h2><p>Not everyone has a ring light, but nearly every scene could benefit from the low light adjustment. This uses AI technology to boost the light making a better quality recording in the vast majority of situations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/adjust-for-low-light-zoom.jpg"                      alt="adjust for low light zoom"                ></p><p>People tend to underestimate the power of good lighting in improving your video quality. Not only is brighter usually better when it comes to lighting but if you record with better light, it gives you more options for adjusting the video quality later on in post-production.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115911/19272" target="_top" id="2115911">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115911" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115911/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Optimize-Video-Quality"><a href="#Optimize-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Optimize Video Quality"></a>Optimize Video Quality</h2><p>Under the advanced settings, there is a toggle called “Optimize video quality with de-noise.” Make sure this is toggled on. This uses AI software-based noise removal to help improve the video quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/optimize-video-quality-zoom.jpg"                      alt="optimize video quality zoom"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115929/19272" target="_top" id="2115929">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115929" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115929/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-a-USB-mic"><a href="#Use-a-USB-mic" class="headerlink" title="Use a USB mic"></a>Use a USB mic</h2><p>Have you ever seen a video with really poor sound quality? It makes a huge difference in how you judge the quality of that video. So if you have a USB mic, use that instead of the built-in microphone. Viewers will subconsciously judge the quality of the video not only on video quality, but also on sound quality. It makes a massive difference to the final video recording.</p><h2 id="Use-a-Virtual-Background"><a href="#Use-a-Virtual-Background" class="headerlink" title="Use a Virtual Background"></a>Use a Virtual Background</h2><p>A cluttered background is never ideal in videos. That’s why the rage on YouTube is to use a camera (Like the Canon M50 for example) that naturally provides a bokeh effect, which is a gentle blurring of the background.</p><p>The reason this is so critical is it helps the viewer focus on what is important - which is your speaker.</p><p>So Under “Backgrounds &amp; Effects” choose a virtual background, or the “blur” option to help improve your source video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-virtual-background-zoom.jpg"                      alt="use virtual background zoom"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982485">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982485.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982485">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982485.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982485%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982485/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting"><a href="#Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Be aware of the different views during your meeting"></a>Be aware of the different views during your meeting</h2><p>Zoom records with a single video file, unlike other software options such as Ecamm or Skype Call Recorder. This means the recording will be very similar to what you see.</p><p>When you are in a meeting, you can toggle between the Gallery view, which shows everyone in the meeting in tiles, and the Speaker view, which shows the main speaker in a full-screen mode.</p><p>The recording will record exactly what is on the screen, so if you want to get some variety, you can toggle between these two during your recording.</p><p>There is also a “Highlight” feature where you can manually select a participant to be highlighted regardless if they are the active speaker or not.</p><p>Here’s another tip. You can choose to hide the participants who don’t have a video stream by adjusting one of the video settings Check “Hide non-video participants.”</p><h2 id="Wipe-your-webcam"><a href="#Wipe-your-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Wipe your webcam"></a>Wipe your webcam</h2><p>Webcams can pick up dust and oil from time to time. So before important recordings (and also because my kids sometimes use my laptop) I usually wipe my webcam with a lint-free microfiber cloth before important Zooms with my colleagues and clients.</p><p>I use the same type of cloth that I use for cleaning my eyeglasses. Keep it simple and clean!</p><h2 id="Upgrade-your-camera"><a href="#Upgrade-your-camera" class="headerlink" title="Upgrade your camera"></a>Upgrade your camera</h2><p>You can add a better webcam or even a mirrorless camera, like the Canon M50 that is popular with YouTubers as a webcam input.

How to Edit the Video After Export from Funimate"></a>Part 3. How to Edit the Video After Export from Funimate</h2><p>Editing videos is a difficult undertaking, particularly if you don’t have the right tools. Filmora is about as versatile as it gets when it comes to video editing software. Filmora is Wondershare’s entry-level, simple-to-use, high-quality video editing software. 4k and gif support are now standard capabilities for most video editing tools, but titles are something Filmora excels at. There are many excellent video editing programs available, but few of them provide the combination of ease of use and capability that Wondershare Filmora does. To begin video editing, you must first import movies from your PC.</p><p>Overall, we feel Filmora is one of the most mind-blowing premium options accessible, especially when combined with other video-related tools from the company. The solution enables you to share instances or gatherings with your colleagues, as well as independently record the sound and video of your framework. The Filmora video editor now supports true 4k videos (both 3840*2160 and 4096*2160), as well as the creation of proxy files for a more fluid video editing experience. In Filmora, you may edit with proxy video files and subsequently export with the full-sized resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get Filmora Toolkit, Install It, And Run It</strong></p><p>To begin your editing experience with Filmora, first, visit the official website and download the most recent version of Wondershare Filmora. When the download is finished, launch the program and click the New Project button to view the product’s underlying window interface.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><strong>Step 2: Remove Any Unnecessary Background Sounds</strong></p><p>Aside from the video editor, DemoCreator Audio Editor allows you to improve the sound of your video.

The intuitive design of TikTok makes it addictive to its users and the simple user interface helps them create video content more conveniently. Thus, TikTok can be called a video editor as well as a social media platform for its global users.</p><p>And one of the main functions of any video editing application is that the user should be able to zoom into videos to showcase specific areas of the video or to make a unique transition. In this article, we are going to learn about face zoom TikTok and how one user can use the Zoom function and make videos with it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video"></a>Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video</h2><p>With its growing popularity, TikTok has been adding many features to its video editing front. And one of such major functions of TikTok is to zoom the video as per your preference. There are two ways in which a user can zoom the video on TikTok.</p><p>The first one involves zooming in while recording the video and the second one is when you are editing it. And while creating a new video, you are needed to pinch into the screen to zoom your video to zoom in and you can pinch out to do a zoom out. The complete stepwise process is explained below:</p><ul><li>First, open the TikTok application and click on the plus “+” icon that will help you to create a new video. This plus icon is placed at the bottom of the TikTok interface.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-new-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="create a new video tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>When you tap on the “+” icon, the recording interface will open up. Now, select the duration of the video by tapping the “clock” icon on the left-hand side of the screen. After selecting a set duration, you will find a red shutter button which you will need to hold to start the recording.</li><li>Now, to zoom in on the recording, you can use any of two methods of zooming in. The first method involves you moving your finger up towards the top of your phone from the shutter icon. This will show you a red circle getting bigger.</li><li>Alternatively, you can use one finger to pinch into the screen while holding the shutter icon with another finger and this will ultimately help you achieve a zoom effect on your video.</li><li>For zooming out, you can move your finger towards the shutter button or pinch out and then save the video.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

So, for any reason, if you forgot to apply zoom in or zoom out while recording, then you can easily apply this effect while editing it.

Our today’s topic is exciting as it’s how you can <strong>write a good documentary script</strong> for your documentary video or film. As all of us know, the script is fundamental for any screenplay as it contains all the dialogues and instructions for the actors in written form. So that’s why it is also essential for your audio or video documentaries. That’s the reason why we are going to discuss this topic here today how you can be able to write effectively.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Literary Style</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Shot-Oriented</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Shooting Script</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to make your own movie</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Ensure the authenticity of the story</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Define the key issues</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Highlight the characteristics of the scene</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-4">Visual Writing</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-5">Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-6">Fully researched</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Documentary script examples</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Make your documentary script come true by using Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script"></a>Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Literary-Style"><a href="#1-Literary-Style" class="headerlink" title="1. Literary Style"></a>1. Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script"></a>Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story"><a href="#1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation.

What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script-1"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented-1"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script-1"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123734/7443" target="_top" id="2123734">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123734" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123734/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues-1"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing-1"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4.

The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4.

For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

When you post your own unique brand of wit and humor in the form of memes, remember to do the same for other people. With the help of this article, you can quickly and effortlessly transform a memorable occasion into a meme that will spread like wildfire.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-What-exactly-is-a-meme"><a href="#1-What-exactly-is-a-meme" class="headerlink" title="1. What exactly is a meme?"></a>1. What exactly is a meme?</h2><p>A meme is an image that is passed around online and is accompanied by some form of writing. These memes typically offer sharp criticism on cultural icons, societal concepts, or current events. A meme is often an image or a video, although it can also take the form of a string of words in some cases. When a meme strikes a chord with a large number of people, it begins to circulate through various social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, messaging, and other methods. The more the number of times a meme is shared, the more of an impact it has on culture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/grandpa-meme-image.jpg"                      alt="grandpa meme image"                ></p><h2 id="2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online"><a href="#2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online" class="headerlink" title="2. When did memes become a thing online?"></a>2. When did memes become a thing online?</h2><p>Memes, which originated as an idea conceived from an improbable source, have emerged as one of the key modes of communication that are used on the internet. Memes have almost completely taken over popular culture, and they can be found just about anywhere. Your favorite artist, a member of your family, or even a politician may be the one who spreads them. Anything, even humans, has the potential to spread virally and turn into a meme. If you get extremely lucky, becoming a meme can even make you famous.</p><p>At one point in time, many believed that memes were nothing more than strange visuals that certain portions of the internet created for their own amusement. They are now an integral element of the typical engagement that takes place on social media and are utilized, shared, and consumed on a minute-to-minute basis. They can take something as harmless as the children’s show Arthur and turn the visuals into something that causes the authors of the series to issue an apology, or they can make fun of the very idea of possessing a certain guitar model.</p><p>People’s lives are becoming increasingly influenced by the internet and various forms of social media, which has coincided with the proliferation of memes in popular culture. Memes have evolved into the ideal medium for disseminating knowledge, comedic content, and political viewpoints as the amount of time spent online continues to rise. Memes have evolved from simple image changes made with the intention of making people laugh into rhetorical devices that are capable of spreading information to millions of people. As a result, memes have established themselves as one of the most important mediums in today’s society. This is how the meme has progressed over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-an-online-meme.jpg"                      alt="create an online meme"                ></p><h2 id="3-How-do-you-make-a-meme"><a href="#3-How-do-you-make-a-meme" class="headerlink" title="3.

All you need is a good picture of something, or someone expressing an emotion such a confusion, happiness, and think of a funny phrase people can relate to.</p><p>Step1 When you set out to create a meme, you should typically do so with an idea in mind. But if that’s not possible, try to come up with a hilarious response.</p><p>Step2 Launch Filmora, then important the photo, and after that, choose the font you want to use. Position the text until it looks like a proper meme.</p><p>Step3 You may show your finished work to your coworkers or friends by saving and uploading it immediately to social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-a-meme-image.jpg"                      alt="customize a meme image"                ></p><p>Memes are a fantastic way to communicate with friends, family, and coworkers.

Researching trending memes"></a>4. Researching trending memes</h2><p>Through the years, many different styles of memes have come and gone. You don’t want to rely on methods that have since become obsolete. Do some research to find out what’s trending by looking through old memes. Also, pay attention to the memes that other people are posting wherever it is on the internet that you spend the majority of your time. It doesn’t matter if it’s Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.</p><p>Try to locate recent memes by browsing subreddits such as r&#x2F;memes and r&#x2F;dankmemes. In addition, there are times when a particular category of meme becomes popular. In that case, you should give those memes a shot and see if you can make them. For instance, Bernie Sanders was a topic of conversation for a few days not too long ago.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Share-your-meme"><a href="#5-Share-your-meme" class="headerlink" title="5.

Although iPhone X is one of the best gadgets in the recent times, it can be pretty complex too. In spite of using the device now, you may not know the hidden <strong>iPhone X tips and tricks</strong>, which Apple keeps adding with each software upgrade. In order to make your daily usage of iPhone X device simple and easy, here are the 10 iPhone X tips and tricks. Run the latest iOS version and get going with these missing features.</p><h2 id="10-Hidden-iPhone-X-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#10-Hidden-iPhone-X-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="10 Hidden iPhone X Tips and Tricks"></a>10 Hidden iPhone X Tips and Tricks</h2><h4 id="1-Take-a-Screenshot-using-iPhone-X-tips-and-tricks"><a href="#1-Take-a-Screenshot-using-iPhone-X-tips-and-tricks" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks"></a>1. Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks</h4><p>Are you used to taking screenshots pressing the side button and the home button? What will you do with your iPhone X? It has no home button. Forget all your worries as the iPhone X tips and tricks help in easing your worries instantly. To take a screenshot on your iPhone X, press the side button and the volume up button simultaneously. The rest of the working is exactly as you see in other iPhones.</p><h4 id="2-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset"></a>2. Hard Reset</h4><p>What, if your iPhone X becomes unresponsive? iPhone X tips and tricks help you to force hard reset the iPhone X by swiftly pressing the volume up button first, then pressing the volume down button, and finally pressing and holding the side button. Apart from holding the side button, do not hold any of the volume buttons. You can observe the Apple logo when you hold the side button for 10-15 seconds and leave it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iPhone-X-Hard-Reset-Buttons-min.png"                      alt="hard reset"                ></p><h4 id="3-Battery-Percentage"><a href="#3-Battery-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="3. Battery Percentage"></a>3. Battery Percentage</h4><p>The iOS doesn’t feature a default battery percentage display. But, the settings can be used to turn on the display for battery percentage. The iPhone X is different, the setting has been removed from this device but don’t you worry. Just from the right side of the notch, swipe down and the option is integrated into the control center.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iOS_battery_percentage.jpg"                      alt="battery percentage"                ></p><h4 id="4-Virtual-Home-Button"><a href="#4-Virtual-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="4. Virtual Home Button"></a>4. Virtual Home Button</h4><p>Are you missing the home button feature on your iPhone X device? Unfortunately, it is not really possible to bring it back physically but replicating the home button is definitely possible with the use of the software. So, what is the procedure to get a home button replica? Go to the general, click on the accessibility feature, then click on the assistive touch, and finally toggle it on. A virtual home button appears on the screen which you may modify to activate the shortcuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-home-button.jpg"                      alt="home button"                ></p><h4 id="5-Optimize-Face-Id"><a href="#5-Optimize-Face-Id" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimize Face Id"></a>5. Optimize Face Id</h4><p>However fast the face ID is, at times, it cannot match up with the touch ID. But, the process of face ID can be accelerated with right habits and settings.</p><p>Firstly, click on the settings and then on the display and brightness feature to ensure “raise to wake” feature is enabled to stop you from having to tap on the screen. Swipe the phone upside so that your face is not seen directly on the screen and the face id gets time to authenticate and when you look to unlock your iPhone with the face ID, it directly takes you to the home screen. You may click on settings and then passcode and face ID to find the “require attention for face ID” feature to unlock the phone without looking directly on the screen. These iPhone X tips and tricks can greatly help to optimize the face ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/settings-face-id2.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><h4 id="6-Quickly-Return-Home"><a href="#6-Quickly-Return-Home" class="headerlink" title="6. Quickly Return Home"></a>6. Quickly Return Home</h4><p>If there’s an opened app screen on your iPhone X, you may go back to the home screen by using the home indicator. And, if multiple app pages are opened on your device’s home screen, you may swipe from the bottom edge which takes you back to the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-indicator-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="return home"                ></p><h4 id="7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera"><a href="#7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera" class="headerlink" title="7. Instantly Open the Camera"></a>7. Instantly Open the Camera</h4><p>Do you want to have the instant camera feature on your iPhone X? Just swipe from right to the left to disclose the camera. You may also 3D Touch the camera icon by pressing the lock screen icon for long. As you long press the lockscreen icon, the camera is revealed for you to take the snapshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-open-camera.jpg"                      alt="open camera"                ></p><h4 id="8-Activate-Siri"><a href="#8-Activate-Siri" class="headerlink" title="8. Activate Siri"></a>8. Activate Siri</h4><p>In order to access Siri, press the side button for long without giving any voice command and activate Siri.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><h4 id="9-Use-Reachability-Again"><a href="#9-Use-Reachability-Again" class="headerlink" title="9. Use Reachability Again"></a>9. Use Reachability Again</h4><p>Do you miss the reachability feature where the display would slide down to reach the icons with one hand on the top of the screen by just a double touch on the home button? Why miss, when you can get it? Yes, the feature has not been removed from the iPhone X but it has just been hidden. Go to the general settings, click on the accessibility feature and scroll down to interaction to enable the reachability. For using the reachability feature, on the home bar bottom of the screen instantly swipe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Accessibility.png"                      alt="Accessibility"                ></p><h4 id="10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps"><a href="#10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps" class="headerlink" title="10. Flip Between Recent Apps"></a>10. Flip Between Recent Apps</h4><p>This is a familiar iPhone X functionality but you might have missed it while setting up your device. It is common for all of us to go through the tutorial quickly and then get to the phone. Isn’t it? But, if you have still missed it, then, from the home screen swipe right on the gesture bar. Now, you can quickly get into flipping between suspended apps. Furthermore, if you have flipped to an app that was not the last opened app, you can swipe both left and right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-multitasking.jpg"                      alt="Flip Between Recent Apps"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Keeping the iPhone X tips and tricks in mind, you get to access all the new and more handy iPhone X device.

It really doesn’t matter what kind of use you put a camera – creative shots, hands-free convenience, or stationary surveillance. For shots that require slow motion, time-lapses, or simply capturing movement, handling tripods are way too much hassle. And when the times (and shots) are too rocky, they’re just not enough to stabilize and focus.</p><p>For times when you’re on a tight budget or with no room for extra equipment, or if you simply aren’t well versed with complex camera functions but love to shoot, the auto-track camera gives way to your creativity to shine.</p><ol><li><strong>What Is The Price Of A Tracking Camera?</strong></li></ol><p>The price of an auto track camera can widely vary according to the features, quality, brand, and additional accessories that you are looking for. On the lower end, you can get a face-tracking camera for $400. At this low price, you may get a decent camera that auto tracks, but it may also mean a compromise on durability, sensor precision, resolution, and quality, among other things.</p><p>On the higher end, with loaded features, high resolution, flexibility in lenses, sound audio recording, you can expect the price to range between one to a few grand easily.</p><ol><li><strong>Where To Buy An Auto Tracking Camera For Sports?</strong></li></ol><p>It is easy to purchase an auto-tracking camera for sports, thanks to the convenience of online shopping. You can find most of these cameras on sites like Amazon at the standard price set by the manufacturer. Also, there is the official company’s e-commerce page and more affiliate blogs and vendors that you can shop from. If you want to physically buy, you can get them at your nearest electronics showrooms.</p><p>To sum it up, when buying an auto track camera, always consider your needs and uses. Each camera specializes in meeting a set of performance expectations. For instance, vlogging needs better resolution, conferences need more precision, and sports need more movement flexibility. Once you have your priorities sorted, this guide is exhaustive to help you with your buying decision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-8-free-instagram-to-mp4-converters-you-can-try-onlinewindowsmac/"><u>[New] In 2024, 8 Free Instagram to MP4 Converters You Can Try [Online/Windows/Mac]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essentials-of-creating-share-worthy-instagram-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Essentials of Creating Share-Worthy Instagram Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/future-scrutiny-alternate-viewpoints/"><u>Future Scrutiny Alternate Viewpoints</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/1722974039103-get-your-dell-latitude-e6420-drivers-in-a-flash-fast-downloads-available/"><u>Get Your Dell Latitude E6420 Drivers in a Flash - Fast Downloads Available!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-iphone-6s-activation-lock-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/"><u>How to bypass iPhone 6s activation lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-audience-engagement-on-demand-top-5-mac-streaming-tools/"><u>In 2024, Audience Engagement On Demand Top 5 Mac Streaming Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-casino-confidential-communiques/"><u>In 2024, CASINO CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNIQUES</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-a-locked-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-proplus-5g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Enable USB Debugging on a Locked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/inside-the-2023-samsung-bd-j5900-innovations/"><u>Inside the 2023 Samsung BD-J5900 Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/mastering-task-management-in-windows-how-to-force-quit-stubborn-apps/"><u>Mastering Task Management in Windows: How to Force Quit Stubborn Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/zoo-logists-best-startup-for-panzoids/"><u>Zoo-Logist's Best Startup for Panzoids</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

After choosing the video, audio, or photo files, you want to use in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/imoive-crop-video-3.jpg"                      alt="imoive-crop-video-"                ></p><p>The Import menu now includes Import with Instant Cutter Tool. The Instant Cutter Tool made trimming 4K and other large video files quick and easy. Filmora can also edit footage shot with action cameras swiftly. You can simply improve your films with the lens correction tools and the Fish Eye Distortion function.</p><h3 id="Step-4-Arrange-Your-Clips-3"><a href="#Step-4-Arrange-Your-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="Step #4: Arrange Your Clips"></a><strong>Step #4: Arrange Your Clips</strong></h3><p>The documents you import into Filmora will be stored under the Media tab, which you can find beneath the Load button. Working with multiple files in a single project becomes significantly more difficult when searching for the films and photographs you want to add to the timeline. To eliminate clutter and annoyance, use the My Album tool to create folders and organize your files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/imoive-crop-video-4.jpg"                      alt="imoive-crop-video-"                ></p><p>In the window’s top right corner, click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section. You can organize the footage numerically or in another method to increase your productivity and save time looking through files.</p><h3 id="Step-5-Organize-the-Files-on-The-Timeline-3"><a href="#Step-5-Organize-the-Files-on-The-Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="Step #5: Organize the Files on The Timeline"></a><strong>Step #5: Organize the Files on The Timeline</strong></h3><p>Because raw footage frequently has incorrect orbits that you don’t need in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and set them on the timeline if you want to delete or edit your videos. You can load as much clips as you want, but you can only add them one at a time, and you’ll have to drag the files to the right place on the timeline to reorder them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/imoive-crop-video-5.jpg"                      alt="imoive-crop-video-"                ></p><p>Press Play or use the Spacebar to examine the video clips you’ve added to the timeline. You may use the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the exact beginning of the video segment you wish to trim, then repeat the operation on the other end.</p><h3 id="Step-6-Insert-Effects-3"><a href="#Step-6-Insert-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Step #6: Insert Effects"></a><strong>Step #6: Insert Effects</strong></h3><p>After eliminating all the unwanted bits from your video clips, you may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the segments, or apply one of Filmora’s many graphic effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/imoive-crop-video-6.jpg"                      alt="imoive-crop-video-"                ></p><p>Click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon to add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video. The software comes with several text templates that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you want to use to the appropriate location on the timeline, then add the relevant text using the software’s preview box.</p><h1 id="BBD0E0-»-3"><a href="#BBD0E0-»-3" class="headerlink" title="BBD0E0 »"></a>BBD0E0 »</h1><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-adventure-showdown-analyzing-gopros-hero5b-and-session/"><u>[Updated] Adventure Showdown Analyzing GoPro's Hero5B & Session</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-slide-show-tools-for-iphone-series-10-13-upgrades/"><u>[Updated] Ideal Slide Show Tools For iPhone Series 10-13 Upgrades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-banishing-black-edges-on-your-youtube-video/"><u>2024 Approved Banishing Black Edges on Your YouTube Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-manuals.techidaily.com/abbyy-study-shows-finance-professionals-uphold-regulations-more-than-public-servants-exclusive-insights/"><u>ABBYY Study Shows Finance Professionals Uphold Regulations More Than Public Servants - Exclusive Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/elevating-instagram-presence-through-bigger-video-content-for-2024/"><u>Elevating Instagram Presence Through Bigger Video Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-cumuluspro-ergonomic-desk-mat-for-healthier-standing-sessions/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the CumulusPRO Ergonomic Desk Mat for Healthier Standing Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/innovative-question-collection-for-lively-podcast-discussions/"><u>Innovative Question Collection for Lively Podcast Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/photo-visionaries-guide-unveiling-the-best-6-high-res-cameras/"><u>Photo Visionaries Guide Unveiling the Best 6 High-Res Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/wacom-intuos-3-driver-installation-guide-for-windows-achieve-optimal-device-efficiency-download-now/"><u>Wacom Intuos 3 Driver Installation Guide for Windows - Achieve Optimal Device Efficiency [Download Now]</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comparative-Review-Top-Cloud-Services’-Prices"><a href="#Comparative-Review-Top-Cloud-Services’-Prices" class="headerlink" title="Comparative Review: Top Cloud Services’ Prices"></a>Comparative Review: Top Cloud Services’ Prices</h2><p>Cloud storage is an increasingly sophisticated area, with more and more suppliers joining the game. Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $72TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.</p><p>The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.</p><p>If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud. They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Price Recommendations"></a>Part 2: Best Price Recommendations</h2><p>Here we recommend the cloud storage services with the best prices in three categories.</p><h3 id="1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage"><a href="#1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage" class="headerlink" title="1. Best price of lifetime license cloud storage"></a>1. Best price of lifetime license cloud storage</h3><p>The following are cloud storage services that give the best <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> for a lifetime license.</p><p><strong>#1. pCloud</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-1.JPG"                      alt="pcloud"                ></p><p>For secure cloud storage services, especially for more official, commercial, and professional users, pCloud will always be the first option that comes to mind.</p><p>Although pCloud is more expensive, the additional security measures and quick sync are worth the cost. The individual plans are as follows:</p><ul><li>500 GB of Premium storage costs $50.</li><li>2 TB of storage for Premium Plus costs $100.</li><li>10 TB storage for Custom storage.</li></ul><p><strong>#2. Icedrive</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-2.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>You can choose between monthly, annual, and lifetime subscriptions with Icedrive. Each offers three different cloud storage options (from the monthly subscription).</p><p>Here are the monthly <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> packages.</p><ul><li>Lite: 150 GB of storage and 250 GB of bandwidth per month for $1.67</li><li>Pro: 1 TB of storage and 2 TB of bandwidth per month for $4.17.</li><li>Pro+: 5 TB of storage and 8 TB of monthly bandwidth per month for $15.</li></ul><p>Creating an account will grant you free access to 10 TB of storage! Already a success for my use.</p><h3 id="2-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-service"><a href="#2-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-service" class="headerlink" title="2. Best price of unlimited cloud storage service"></a>2. Best price of unlimited cloud storage service</h3><p>For the best <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> for unlimited storage, here is a list of a few recommended cloud storage services.</p><p><strong>#1. Sync.com</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-3.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>The service offers one of the industry’s most excellent versioning systems, broad file-sharing functionality, outstanding security, and privacy.</p><p>Sync.com offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>Teams Standard Plan for 1TB of storage space costs $6 per month, billed annually</li><li>Teams Unlimited Plan for Unlimited storage space costs $15 per month, billed annually.</li><li>Enterprise plan – Custom pricing</li></ul><p><strong>#2. Dropbox</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-4.JPG"                      alt="dropbox"                ></p><p>It established numerous file-sharing and syncing trends currently refined. Dropbox first used the sync-folder model, and this version is among the finest.</p><p>Dropbox offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>The Dropbox Plus plan for 2TB of storage space costs $10 monthly</li><li>The Dropbox Family Plan for 2TB storage space costs $17 monthly</li></ul><h3 id="3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service"><a href="#3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service" class="headerlink" title="3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><strong>#1. Sync.com</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><strong>#2. IceDrive</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><strong>#3. Google Drive</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free" class="headerlink" title="2.

Which cloud storage is the cheapest?"></a>3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain.

The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><strong>#2.

Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><strong>#3.

Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

You’re certainly not looking to drop thousands of dollars on one. Fortunately, there are some affordable options available to you.</p><h2 id="1-Ricoh-Theta-S"><a href="#1-Ricoh-Theta-S" class="headerlink" title="1. Ricoh Theta S"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://theta360.com/en/about/theta/s.html" >Ricoh Theta S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>First, an offering from Ricoh, the Ricoh Theta S. This pocket-sized camera costs around $350 and is super simple to use. It has exactly one button for taking photos or videos. The camera can connect via USB or HDMI, but is also Wi-Fi capable, allowing you to transfer footage to your iPhone. This camera shoots at 14 megapixels, and 30 fps. There are several apps associated with it: one allowing you to edit your videos, as well as one that acts as a live-view feed and remote control to make shooting even easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affordable-360-camera-ricoh-theta-s.jpg"                      alt="affordable 360 camera - Ricoh Theta S"                ></p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Ricoh Theta S &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-360fly-4K"><a href="#2-360fly-4K" class="headerlink" title="2. 360fly 4K"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.360fly.com/360fly-4k.html" >360fly 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>The 360fly 4k is a slightly more expensive option, retailing around $500. Unlike many other 360-degree cameras, it has only a single lens to capture its video, meaning that there is no stitching together of two images to create a seamless image. Like the Ricoh camera, it offers an app, 360fly, to connect to your iOS device and act as a remote control. A second app, Livit, is offered to allow live streaming of your videos, along with editing. The 360fly camera is heavier duty than some of the other options out there, with water, dust, and shock-resistant body. It also offers a great image, with 2880x2880 resolution, 30fps, and a 240-degree vertical field of view. It also has some built-in sensors, including a barometer, accelerometer, and a GPS sensor.</p><p>Check this video to watch the 360fly 4k unboxing review:</p><h2 id="3-Giroptic"><a href="#3-Giroptic" class="headerlink" title="3.

This camera uses 3 fisheye lenses and combines images into a 360-degree whole in real-time. It has three built-in microphones to capture sound and a gyroscope and accelerometer to stabilize images for videos, photo bursts, and other types of footage. It offers slightly less resolution for video, about 2K at 30fps, but 4K for still images. The 360cam app, for iOS, lets you remotely control the camera over Wi-Fi, but also lets you view, edit and share photos and videos.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Giroptic &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Have a quick review on Giroptic from this video:</p><h2 id="4-Kodak-PixPro-SP360-4K"><a href="#4-Kodak-PixPro-SP360-4K" class="headerlink" title="4.

It relies on a dome-shaped, fixed focus 235-degree lens to capture 360-degree video. Starting at $449 from Kodak, this camera isn’t excessively expensive, though it’s also not the cheapest offering. It shoots 2880x2880 video at 30 fps. It can also shoot stills at resolutions up to 8MP. While not the best image quality among the camera offerings, Kodak’s camera is tough – resistant to water, dust, and shocks – making it a good choice if you find yourself on adventures where being careful with your precious camera isn’t always your first priority.</p><p>A wonderful day with PixPro SP360 4K:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="320" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-LG360-cam"><a href="#5-LG360-cam" class="headerlink" title="5.

It captures 2K, 360-degree video, and 5.1 channel surround sound, as well as allowing you to use only one of its two lenses for 180-degree image capture. It’s a small camera with no built-in display, but the companion app acts as a remote control and lets you view your recording in real-time.</p><p>Check a detailed review about LG360 Cam from this video</p><h2 id="6-ALLie-Camera"><a href="#6-ALLie-Camera" class="headerlink" title="6.

One interesting feature is the 10 built-in infrared LEDs that allow you to film in dark environments with a full 360-degree view. Its integrated microphone and speaker allows two-way audio so that users can communicate. Its app lets you view the footage from anywhere and, if your mobile device has gyroscopic motion sensors, change your perspective while viewing footage by tilting and moving the screen.
