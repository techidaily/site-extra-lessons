    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Future-of-Videos-Assessing-AV1’s-Edge-over-VP9"><a href="#The-Future-of-Videos-Assessing-AV1’s-Edge-over-VP9" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Videos: Assessing AV1’s Edge over VP9"></a>The Future of Videos: Assessing AV1’s Edge over VP9</h2><p>The advancement in video technology means there are many video codecs to use. Today, you can use  VP9, AV1 and other codecs on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, Vimeo, and more. However, video codecs differ regarding file size, licensing, quality, and more. Now this brings us to the exciting <strong>AV1 vs VP9</strong> comparison. These two are currently some of the most widely used video codecs, especially on YouTube. So, which one should you use? Should you stick to the trusted VP9 or the brand-new AV1? This article helps you make the critical choice.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-VP9"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-VP9" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is VP9?"></a>Part 1. What is VP9?</h2><p>Released in 2013 by Google, VP9 is a free, open-source video codec that replaced VP8. This compression algorithm was released to compete with  a licensed video codec. VP9 enjoys broad support among modern HTML5 web browsers. In fact, VP9 has been compatible with Android since version 4.4 KitKat. This codec is also compatible with iOS&#x2F;iPadOS 14 or newer.</p><p>In the meantime, a 2014 comparison between VP9 and &#x2F;AVC discovered that VP9 offers a 45% bitrate advantage over. Netflix also concluded in 2016 that VP9  could have the same efficiency after tweaking the parameters. So overall, VP9 supports lossless encoding of raw bitstreams, making it perfect for streaming videos in MP4 and WebM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-AV1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is AV1?"></a>Part 2. What is AV1?</h2><p>AV1 is a relatively new video codec by Alliance for Open Media, a consortium of which Google is a co-founder. Like VP9, it’s a royalty-free video codec, meaning you don’t have to pay licensing fee to use it. AV1 was developed to replace VP9, so expect it to be compatible with all VP9-supported platforms. Besides Google, the Alliance for Open Media also includes Netflix, Amazon, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla.</p><p>The first AV1 version was released in 2016 but was held back due to unresolved critical bugs. Then in March 2018, the Alliance announced another release alongside software encoder&#x2F;decoder. Although the codec is primarily designed to compete with licensed codecs like  AVC, there are concerns that it may threaten the existence of other royalty-free codecs. But as a consumer, freebies are always a welcome addition.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135415/19272" target="_top" id="2135415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Detailed-Comparison-Between-VP9-and-AV1"><a href="#Part-3-Detailed-Comparison-Between-VP9-and-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Detailed Comparison Between VP9 and AV1"></a>Part 3. Detailed Comparison Between VP9 and AV1</h2><p>For viewers to enjoy high-quality content without using a lot of resources, efficient video compression technology is a must. As it stands, both VP9 and AV1 are royalty-free codecs, meaning that they are 100% free to use. However, these codecs differ. Here is what we’ve gathered for the <strong>VP9 vs AV1</strong> comparison:</p><h3 id="Compatibility-VP9-has-an-edge"><a href="#Compatibility-VP9-has-an-edge" class="headerlink" title="Compatibility - VP9 has an edge"></a>Compatibility - VP9 has an edge</h3><p>Both video compression techniques are relatively new, which AV1 being the latest. This means VP9 and AV1 are compatible with various HTML5 browsers and devices. Google says VP9 decoding is compatible with more than 2 billion endpoints, meaning you can open VP9 on Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Android smartphones&#x2F;TVs, and local media players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-1.jpg"                      alt="compatibility"                ></p><p>But on the other hand, viewers might experience an “error” message when opening AV1 locally on your old PC. While Intel works around the clock to develop supported drivers, some may not be compatible with your old computer. But expect wider AV1 compatibility now that more tech companies like Meta, Samsung, and Apple have joined the Alliance for Open Media. Currently, YouTube and Netflix are already streaming some videos in AV1.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014854/22899" target="_top" id="2014854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014854/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Performance-AV1-has-an-edge"><a href="#Performance-AV1-has-an-edge" class="headerlink" title="Performance - AV1 has an edge"></a>Performance - AV1 has an edge</h3><p>Regarding practical performance, it’s widely agreed that AV1 has the upper hand over standard codecs like VP9, and VP8. According to a test by EpsosVox on Intel’s AV1 encoder, the codec showed higher performance efficiency than NVIDIA’s NVENC, OBS x264, and AMF by AMD. The test results showed that the AV1 encoder is 16% better than the competing encoders.</p><p>Another 2018 Facebook Engineering (now Meta) test showed that AV1 achieved 34% higher compression than VP9. The test also showed that AV1 is 50.3% and 46.2% better than the x264 main profile and x264 high profile. However, the test showed that AV1 requires a longer encoding duration than the current alternative due to the complexities involved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-2.jpg"                      alt="facebook av1 vs vp9 comparison"                ></p><p>Most importantly, Facebook suggested that AV1’s performance significantly increases with increased video resolution. This means viewers will enjoy a higher quality 8K and UHD&#x2F;4K content when using AV1 than VP9 and other codecs. And yes, higher compressions by AV1 mean a smaller file size at the same bitrates as the VP9 codec.</p><h3 id="Into-the-Future-AV1-is-the-Trend"><a href="#Into-the-Future-AV1-is-the-Trend" class="headerlink" title="Into the Future - AV1 is the Trend"></a>Into the Future - AV1 is the Trend</h3><p>You probably know that AV1 comes from VP9 and is having difficulties in widespread use due to longer decoding times. But things are different now.</p><p>In the year of 2022, AV1 hardware encoder made amazing progress in supports from graphics card manufacturers—August, Intel’s new Arc Alchemist GPUs integrates with AV1 encoding and the Intel Arc AV1 Encoder Easily Beats AMD and Nvidia.</p><p>YouTube Video: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LznXh5lkgB0" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LznXh5lkgB0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Soon in the September, NVIDIA unveiled the GeForce RTX® 40 Series of GPUs, which comes with Dual NVIDIA Encoders (NVENC) that is able to “cut export times by up to half and feature AV1 support”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-3.jpg"                      alt="cut export times"                ></p><p>Let alone AV2 is upcoming in 3-5 years.

The intuitive design of TikTok makes it addictive to its users and the simple user interface helps them create video content more conveniently. Thus, TikTok can be called a video editor as well as a social media platform for its global users.</p><p>And one of the main functions of any video editing application is that the user should be able to zoom into videos to showcase specific areas of the video or to make a unique transition. In this article, we are going to learn about face zoom TikTok and how one user can use the Zoom function and make videos with it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video"></a>Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video</h2><p>With its growing popularity, TikTok has been adding many features to its video editing front. And one of such major functions of TikTok is to zoom the video as per your preference. There are two ways in which a user can zoom the video on TikTok.</p><p>The first one involves zooming in while recording the video and the second one is when you are editing it. And while creating a new video, you are needed to pinch into the screen to zoom your video to zoom in and you can pinch out to do a zoom out. The complete stepwise process is explained below:</p><ul><li>First, open the TikTok application and click on the plus “+” icon that will help you to create a new video. This plus icon is placed at the bottom of the TikTok interface.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-new-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="create a new video tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>When you tap on the “+” icon, the recording interface will open up. Now, select the duration of the video by tapping the “clock” icon on the left-hand side of the screen. After selecting a set duration, you will find a red shutter button which you will need to hold to start the recording.</li><li>Now, to zoom in on the recording, you can use any of two methods of zooming in. The first method involves you moving your finger up towards the top of your phone from the shutter icon. This will show you a red circle getting bigger.</li><li>Alternatively, you can use one finger to pinch into the screen while holding the shutter icon with another finger and this will ultimately help you achieve a zoom effect on your video.</li><li>For zooming out, you can move your finger towards the shutter button or pinch out and then save the video.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Zoom an existing TikTok video</h2><p>TikTok is known to provide a vast number of filters as well as editing tools that can create stunning videos with very less effort. And the zoom effect is one of such important functions of video making. If you are new to this then you should know that either you can apply a zoom while creating the video or after recording it. So, for any reason, if you forgot to apply zoom in or zoom out while recording, then you can easily apply this effect while editing it. To zoom TikTok video, you will need to follow these steps:</p><ul><li>First, open any video from your camera roll and upload it to the TikTok application by sharing it to its interface. Alternatively, you can head to the TikTok application and browse your video from the camera roll.</li><li>After uploading the video to the TikTok interface, find the option that says “Visual effects” and then navigate to “Effects”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-visual-effects-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="tap visual effects tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>Here you will need to find an effect namely the “zoom effect” and tapping on it will apply the effect to your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-zoom-effect-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="choose zoom effect tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>You can drag the marker of the timeline to set the beginning of the effect on your video. Then press the zoom effect and release it where you want the zoom effect to end.</li><li>Then save the video and the effect will be applied successfully.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-face-zoom-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-face-zoom-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to face zoom TikTok"></a>Part 3. How to face zoom TikTok</h2><p>One of the main reasons why TikTok is so popular amongst users is because its developers give extensive effort to creating amazing effects and filters for the interface. While Snapchat may have been the first application that brought the trend of filters, TikTok has created a whole another level of hype for such effects. And face zoom on TikTok is such a popular option that is used by billions of users.</p><p>And if you are new to this platform, you can follow these steps to use this face zoom feature of TikTok to create awesome videos:</p><ul><li>First, open the TikTok application and go to the effects section of the interface.

You can usually spot this as soon as you open the camera of the TikTok interface.</li><li>When you have located and clicked on the effects section of the TikTok application, there will be a bunch of categories of filters and effects listed according to their family and popularity. Tap on the option that says “Trending” and it will lead you to the trending effects on the TikTok interface.</li><li>Now, scroll down to browse all the filters and find the effect with the title “Zoom TikTok Filter”. This filter has an icon of a smiling face on the screen with a square box of white shade.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-tiktok-filter.jpg"                      alt="zoom tiktok filter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151888/7443" target="_top" id="2151888">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151888" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151888/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>The filter icon background is of turquoise color.

In reality, review videos can be ridiculously over the top or unconventional. But nevertheless, gives the viewer all the information that a review would give.</p><p>Product Review or Product testing is a way for companies to get real user feedback on a product or service before pushing it to market. To do this, companies ship you a free physical product to use in exchange for a candid review. At the end of the testing period, they typically let you keep the item. Some might even pay you in cash. But in case-to-case basis, most company varies to pay content creator when the channel audience statistics are good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/set-up-camera-mayang.jpg"                      alt="set up camera mayang"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043596/7443" target="_top" id="2043596">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043596" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043596/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid to Review Products"></a>How to Get Paid to Review Products</h2><p>You must have a channel that is stable in a sense with good statistics especially in the audience</p><p>There are companies that want you to have at least 1000 Subscribers on your YouTube channel and at least 1000 followers on Facebook page, Instagram and even TikTok account. Companies also choose YouTubers who they think can do what they want well. They also look at the audience statistic of the channel, from there they will also know what product they are offering and how much payment they can pay for the review.</p><p>One of the great things about YouTube, both as a source of income and as a creative outlet, is that there are so many ways to be successful.</p><p>This kind of work is not easy, especially when you’re doing a skin care products review there are times that the products is not suitable for your skin type, you can feel itchy and sore. So, you have to be very carefully in accepting products to review, do some research about the product ingredients, you know your skin type so it is easy for you to identified if it’s good for you or not. It’s not because you will receive free products and payment for review, immediately you will accept the offer, you must consider the product if its compatible to your skin because at the end of the day it’s your skin, it’s your channel who will sacrifice if you make a wrong decision.</p><p>The next universal thing you do is be honest with your viewers when making sponsored content.</p><p>This applies to YouTubers of all stripes, but even more so when we’re talking about YouTubers who review products. If you have been paid to do a particular review, regardless of whether the review is 100% honest and not flattering at all for the product, even if all the company did was send you a free product to do the review with and aren’t actually paying you, you need to tell your viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/product-review-video-mayang.jpg"                      alt="product review video mayang"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997630/19272" target="_top" id="1997630">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997630" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997630/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee"><a href="#How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee" class="headerlink" title="How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee"></a>How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee</h2><p>As a YouTuber, talent fee is the fee given by the companies when a person reviews their product. The payments depend on your channel status and other social media account.</p><p>Sometime companies ask you to cross posted your review to all your social media account because based on them there are also followers on social media that is not a subscriber. They also want a wide market for you to post their products.</p><p>As for the charging of the companies, it depends on you, if you think your skills in vlogging are enough, then you can ask for higher payment but if you think the price is reasonable for your hard work just go for it. The companies will still negotiate with you regarding the price so you should open to that and should level the price you charge to the company with your work. Sometime they also offer an ex-deal, meaning half of the payment is products then half of it is money. Example you ask for payment like 100$, 250$ of that is worth of all products and the another 250$ will pay thru your preferred bank. So, you will receive a lot of product amounting of the asking price. The question is, what will you do of those products? You can have it for your raffles or giveaways for your channel in that way you can attract more viewers and subscriber and you can also sell that to convert the products into cash. But also check the contract if that way is allowed, because sometimes companies also have restrictions regarding ex-deals. Remember to always read carefully the contract before signing so you won’t have any problem in the long run.</p><p><strong>My Example of Rate Card</strong></p><p><strong>Rate of (Amount) for</strong></p><ol><li>1 YouTube Vlog about the product</li><li>1 IG repost of the YT Vlog (to be posted on feed) cross-posted to Facebook</li><li>1 IG Story</li><li>1 TikTok Video</li></ol><p><strong>Things to Remember to do a Quality Product Review Vlog</strong></p><p>In order for you to have paid product reviews you need to consider the following</p><p><strong>Quality Videos</strong></p><p>You need to make quality videos, because of course the companies don’t just look at the channel statistics, they also check if you make a video that approved to their standard. The video you make is will be used or posted to their website or other social media platform that is why work hard to make your video stand out to the company.</p><p><strong>Perfect Equipment for Vlogging</strong></p><p>Have at least the equipment for vlogging is good because of course it’s embarrassing for the company that you will receive payment and then the video is blurry and the audio is noisy. It’s about time to invest in the vlogging equipment if you receive such offer, that’s for the quality video’s sake.</p><p><strong>Quality Content</strong></p><p>It’s not just the video only that are good, the content should also be well made, think about your work carefully so that you don’t embarrass the brand and your subscriber. It’s not just that you review a product on the channel, you should also think of other ways to create quality content be creative and wise in making good content. Remember there are a lot of Youtuber that same content as you.</p><p><strong>Editing Software</strong></p><p>In order to say that you have made quality content and quality video, when it comes to editing your work must be done well. There are people who are good at editing, they give so much time and effort to make their video creative to stands out to other channel. As you know there are a lot of vloggers doing the same kind of content, so in order for you to stand out, you must put an effort to your editing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> one of the most trusted video editing software when it comes to make quality videos.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title.

Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4.

But like most After Effects title templates, it is entirely customizable, meaning that you can choose to keep its minimalistic design while changing the overall color scheme.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/black-white-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="black white ae title tempalte"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template-1"><a href="#5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4. Create an Exit Animation</em></strong></p><p>You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;</p><p>Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers &gt; Pre-compose.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-on-exit-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="create on exit animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Move the playhead to about 3 seconds and then click on “Edit” and select “Split Layer.” Delete the top Split Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/delete-the-top-split-layer.jpg"                      alt="delete the top split layer"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the comp that is remaining and click on “Edit” to select “Duplicate.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-duplicate-ae.jpg"                      alt="edit duplicate ae"                ></p><p>Step4 Right-click on the duplicated layer and choose “Time” to select “Time Reverse Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/time-reverse-layer-ae.jpg"                      alt="time reverse layer ae"                ></p><p>Step5 Move the duplicated layers to the right until you find that there are no gaps between the two layers.</p><p><strong><em>5. Add Color to the Animation</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add color to the animation to make it stand out a little bit more, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window &gt; Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.</p><p>Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-color-to-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="add color to animation ae"                ></p><p>Step3 Move the points on the screen to change the intensity and direction of the gradient as desired.</p><p>Step4 You can then use the “Effects Window” to change the color as desired.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-conquering-screenshots-a-compreayer-on-lenovo-tech-for-2024/"><u>[New] Conquering Screenshots A Compreayer on Lenovo Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-pristineai-designs-crafting-visuals-with-ai/"><u>[New] PristineAI Designs Crafting Visuals with AI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-checklist-for-successful-in-stream-fb-ads/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Checklist for Successful In-Stream FB Ads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-ace-your-gift-shopping-the-ultimate-guide-to-selecting-specialty-stores/"><u>[Updated] Ace Your Gift Shopping The Ultimate Guide to Selecting Specialty Stores</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-bring-your-footage-to-life-master-the-art-with-these-11-color-edits/"><u>[Updated] Bring Your Footage to Life Master the Art with These 11 Color Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-optibackup-insider-opinions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] OptiBackup Insider Opinions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-overcoming-facebook-algorithm-change-hurdles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Overcoming Facebook Algorithm Change Hurdles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-manuals.techidaily.com/explore-enhanced-text-manipulation-in-emeditor-v232-preview-builds-from-231-professional-editor-tool/"><u>Explore Enhanced Text Manipulation in EmEditor v23.2 Preview (Builds From 23.1) – Professional Editor Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/fixed-win10-plus-geforce-7025-nforce-630a-dispute/"><u>Fixed: Win10 + GeForce 7025, nForce 630a Dispute</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/imovie-trimming-query-the-reason-behind-video-cropping/"><u>IMovie Trimming Query The Reason Behind Video Cropping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-oppo-a38-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Oppo A38 Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/restorerite-professionals-insight-for-2024/"><u>RestoreRite Professionals Insight for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-crash-course-in-surf-cameras-2e3/"><u>The Crash Course in Surf Cameras (2E3)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/top-techniques-for-professional-voice-capture/"><u>Top Techniques for Professional Voice Capture</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

According to the German director Werner Herzog, we have a nice technology but we do not have any idea about how to fill that technology with content. While in one hand developers are a bit confused regarding the development of a VR game and on the other hand, users are frustrated with the quantity of content. But the scenario will soon change expected by the experts.</p><h2 id="The-cost-of-creating-VR-content-is-too-high"><a href="#The-cost-of-creating-VR-content-is-too-high" class="headerlink" title="The cost of creating VR content is too high"></a>The cost of creating VR content is too high</h2><p> There is very little doubt regarding the acceptability and advancement of this technology but there are some bitter realities about this technology that users have to accept. The very first one is the cost. There is no denying that the cost of making a VR game or video is quite a few times higher than normal. So, the developers have to think of it in advance and if they are not a big company, it becomes difficult most of the time. What if the VR game or movie flops? It is quite possible and in such situations, managing the money becomes really very difficult. And there is time concern as well. And according to the market experts, the return on investment is very low. So, the developers who will be crating the VR games will be in fix whether that will make them profit or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-bitter-reality.jpg"                      alt="vr-bitter-reality "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-quality-of-VR-headset-is-not-stable"><a href="#The-quality-of-VR-headset-is-not-stable" class="headerlink" title="The quality of VR headset is not stable"></a>The quality of VR headset is not stable</h2><p> Well, now let’s focus on the quality of the VR headsets. Hundreds of companies are there offering these headsets. All are claiming theirs to be the best but what is the truth? Many of them are not even close to the standard that the viewers expect. The problem mostly persists with the small companies. There is no issue with the big brands like Oculus, HTC, and PSVR. But if you want to compromise with the price, you will end buy buying a piece of crap. And then comes the question of content. You are spending hundreds of dollars for a VR headset and just within a month you are out of content. So, what is the point of buying one then? This makes the buyers really very confused. And to be very frank with you, there is no particular solution to it yet.</p><p> So, what should be done? Whether the buyers should buy costly headsets or they should buy a cheap one since they are going to experience the lack of content soon? Well, giving the answer may be a bit tough right at this moment but the scenario will change soon. VR video, 360 degree photography, these are still very new and should be given some time to explore. The method of VR video is still exploring, the camera angles, shooting angles, lights, requirements; everything is very much new and there is no set standard yet. But with the constant advancement, visitors will soon experience a whole new set of contents that will change their video watching and gaming experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-content-quality.jpg"                      alt="vr-content-quality "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943750/22993" target="_top" id="1943750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943750/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105873/7443" target="_top" id="2105873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exclusive-access-to-the-finest-ae-templates-all-free/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Exclusive Access to The Finest AE Templates, All-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-asmr-mastery-your-guide-to-nighttime-relaxation/"><u>[New] ASMR Mastery Your Guide to Nighttime Relaxation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-6-innovative-mc-house-concepts-for-community-living/"><u>[Updated] 6 Innovative MC House Concepts for Community Living</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-a-deep-dive-into-the-fundamentals-of-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] A Deep Dive Into The Fundamentals of YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-best-digital-solutions-for-converting-images-to-film/"><u>[Updated] Best Digital Solutions for Converting Images to Film</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/acid-pro-a-deep-dive-and-competitive-matchups-for-2024/"><u>ACID Pro A Deep Dive & Competitive Matchups for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/eco-screen-shots-download-free-guides-for-cinematic-creation-for-2024/"><u>Eco-Screen Shots Download Free Guides for Cinematic Creation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-building-connections-with-your-channels-audience/"><u>In 2024, Building Connections with Your Channel's Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/investigating-the-crop-code-in-imovie-for-2024/"><u>Investigating the Crop Code in iMovie for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s no secret that podcasting is on the rise—more than 2.6 billion people in the world today consume audio content regularly.</p><p>As a result, more people are starting their podcasts, and many are making money. But how much does a podcaster make, and is it enough to live on? We’ll examine how different podcasters make and why there’s so much variation.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Complementary products</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Listeners’ donations</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Affiliate</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Popular Podcasts Earnings in 2024</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Are-Podcasts-Profitable"><a href="#Part-1-Are-Podcasts-Profitable" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Are Podcasts Profitable?"></a>Part 1: Are Podcasts Profitable?</h2><p>Podcasts are among the most underutilized marketing tools around today.

These days, podcasters are finding that their podcasts are very profitable. Some people say that podcasts are the only business where you can make a full-time living without owning real estate.</p><p>The secret? Make sure your podcast is something that people want to listen to. If people are listening, you can make money selling ads and subscriptions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Money-Do-Podcasters-Make"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Money-Do-Podcasters-Make" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Money Do Podcasters Make?"></a>Part 2: How Much Money Do Podcasters Make?</h2><p>Podcaster earnings vary widely. Most people who have made their first million by podcasting make no more than half a million dollars a year.</p><p>Consider a scenario to figure out what podcasters can expect to earn and how much they’ll need to invest in their studios and equipment. Let’s say you’re a podcaster and you have the following stats:</p><ul><li>5% of your audience buys a product through your link, earning you $20 for each.</li><li>Your 3% audience supports you on Patreon, leaving you with $7 per person per month.</li><li>1% of your audience purchases a monthly online course for $49.</li><li>You’re making about 5 podcasts per month.</li><li>And lastly, you’re placing 4 ads in every episode, spaced out throughout the episode.</li></ul><p>Considering all the statistics and more than 1,000 downloads&#x2F;listeners per episode, you could make more than $1000 per month, which is a good amount.</p><ul><li>$300&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$210&#x2F;month from Patreon support</li><li>$490&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $1000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p>If you have 5000 download&#x2F;listeners per episode:</p><ul><li>$1500&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$1050&#x2F;month from Patreon Support</li><li>$2450&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $5000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> These numbers are only speculative and assumptions. Depending on various factors, you could make anywhere from $1,000-$50,000 or more. That includes your reputation, strategy, and niche.</p><p>An example of this could include things like how much you want to charge to Patreon or possibly having a higher CPM sponsorship offer, or cost per thousand listeners based on expected performance and other factors.</p><h2 id="Part-3-All-Possible-Income-Sources-for-Podcasters"><a href="#Part-3-All-Possible-Income-Sources-for-Podcasters" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: All Possible Income Sources for Podcasters"></a>Part 3: All Possible Income Sources for Podcasters</h2><p>Many people would love to get paid to talk about their passions. That’s pretty much how it started for every podcaster. Yet, even though it may be easy to start a podcast, it’s not always so easy to make a living at it.</p><p>We’ll show you a bunch of ways podcasters earn a living doing something they love. Let’s take a look…</p><h3 id="Sponsorship"><a href="#Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorship"></a>Sponsorship</h3><p>In a podcast, a sponsor is the first thing you need to think about when seeking to make money from your podcast. With so many podcast ad networks, there are many options for advertisers wanting to advertise on podcasts. Podcasters hire networks, negotiate terms, and secure content on their behalf.</p><p>You need at least 5,000 listeners per month to be accepted by Midroll or Authentic. Suppose you don’t have a minimum number of listeners, you can always connect directly with sponsors, but your niche audience must be a perfect fit to get accepted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-2.jpg"                      alt="marketing charts"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151865/7443" target="_top" id="2151865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151865/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100526/7443" target="_top" id="2100526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Complementary-products"><a href="#Complementary-products" class="headerlink" title="Complementary products"></a>Complementary products</h3><p>As a podcaster, you are your merchant. There are some obvious items that you need to sell, such as t-shirts, caps, mugs and more.</p><p>You don’t have to sell everything; start small and grow. Promoting complementary products in your podcast is the best way to make extra income.</p><p>It’s important to know the best ways to market your brand through various platforms like, selling through a third party like eBay or Etsy that allow podcasters to sell their wares at wholesale pricing.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind when selling merchandising is that the more niche your podcast is, the less likely you will be able to sell a lot of it. Instead, focus on making quality items that appeal to your target audience.</p><h3 id="Listeners’-donations"><a href="#Listeners’-donations" class="headerlink" title="Listeners’ donations"></a>Listeners’ donations</h3><p>If you don’t have any other income sources, consider crowdfunding and&#x2F;or donations to help you keep producing high-quality content. Crowdfunding is the act of funding a project or venture by raising funds from a large group of people.</p><p>Crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo allow people to share ideas and raise money for personal projects. You’ll need to carefully screen your donors, but if you’re willing to take some chances, the rewards can be pretty lucrative.</p><p>The downside is that, if you reach your fundraising goal, your funds may run out before you’re ready to launch your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-3.jpg"                      alt="indiegogo funds"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Affiliate"><a href="#Affiliate" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate"></a>Affiliate</h3><p>One of the quickest ways to generate income for your podcast is to monetize it through affiliate marketing. With affiliate marketing, you make money when your audience purchases something through an affiliate link that you provide them.</p><p>You could sell a related product, share your affiliate link through social media or email, or even host a giveaway and earn a commission when someone enters their information.</p><p>In addition to the many affiliate marketing programs, some are specifically for podcasting, such as Amazon and ShareASale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-4.jpg"                      alt="amazon affiliate program commission rate"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Popular-Podcasts-Earnings-in-2024"><a href="#Part-4-Popular-Podcasts-Earnings-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Popular Podcasts Earnings in 2024"></a>Part 4: Popular Podcasts Earnings in 2024</h2><p>So many people are trying to figure out the best ways to make money online.

If people are listening, you can make money selling ads and subscriptions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068432/7443" target="_top" id="2068432">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068432" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068432/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Money-Do-Podcasters-Make-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Money-Do-Podcasters-Make-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Money Do Podcasters Make?"></a>Part 2: How Much Money Do Podcasters Make?</h2><p>Podcaster earnings vary widely. Most people who have made their first million by podcasting make no more than half a million dollars a year.</p><p>Consider a scenario to figure out what podcasters can expect to earn and how much they’ll need to invest in their studios and equipment. Let’s say you’re a podcaster and you have the following stats:</p><ul><li>5% of your audience buys a product through your link, earning you $20 for each.</li><li>Your 3% audience supports you on Patreon, leaving you with $7 per person per month.</li><li>1% of your audience purchases a monthly online course for $49.</li><li>You’re making about 5 podcasts per month.</li><li>And lastly, you’re placing 4 ads in every episode, spaced out throughout the episode.</li></ul><p>Considering all the statistics and more than 1,000 downloads&#x2F;listeners per episode, you could make more than $1000 per month, which is a good amount.</p><ul><li>$300&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$210&#x2F;month from Patreon support</li><li>$490&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $1000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p>If you have 5000 download&#x2F;listeners per episode:</p><ul><li>$1500&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$1050&#x2F;month from Patreon Support</li><li>$2450&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $5000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> These numbers are only speculative and assumptions. Depending on various factors, you could make anywhere from $1,000-$50,000 or more. That includes your reputation, strategy, and niche.</p><p>An example of this could include things like how much you want to charge to Patreon or possibly having a higher CPM sponsorship offer, or cost per thousand listeners based on expected performance and other factors.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-All-Possible-Income-Sources-for-Podcasters-1"><a href="#Part-3-All-Possible-Income-Sources-for-Podcasters-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: All Possible Income Sources for Podcasters"></a>Part 3: All Possible Income Sources for Podcasters</h2><p>Many people would love to get paid to talk about their passions. That’s pretty much how it started for every podcaster. Yet, even though it may be easy to start a podcast, it’s not always so easy to make a living at it.</p><p>We’ll show you a bunch of ways podcasters earn a living doing something they love. Let’s take a look…</p><h3 id="Sponsorship-1"><a href="#Sponsorship-1" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorship"></a>Sponsorship</h3><p>In a podcast, a sponsor is the first thing you need to think about when seeking to make money from your podcast. With so many podcast ad networks, there are many options for advertisers wanting to advertise on podcasts. Podcasters hire networks, negotiate terms, and secure content on their behalf.</p><p>You need at least 5,000 listeners per month to be accepted by Midroll or Authentic. Suppose you don’t have a minimum number of listeners, you can always connect directly with sponsors, but your niche audience must be a perfect fit to get accepted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-2.jpg"                      alt="marketing charts"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Complementary-products-1"><a href="#Complementary-products-1" class="headerlink" title="Complementary products"></a>Complementary products</h3><p>As a podcaster, you are your merchant.

When you post your own unique brand of wit and humor in the form of memes, remember to do the same for other people. With the help of this article, you can quickly and effortlessly transform a memorable occasion into a meme that will spread like wildfire.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-What-exactly-is-a-meme"><a href="#1-What-exactly-is-a-meme" class="headerlink" title="1. What exactly is a meme?"></a>1. What exactly is a meme?</h2><p>A meme is an image that is passed around online and is accompanied by some form of writing. These memes typically offer sharp criticism on cultural icons, societal concepts, or current events. A meme is often an image or a video, although it can also take the form of a string of words in some cases. When a meme strikes a chord with a large number of people, it begins to circulate through various social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, messaging, and other methods. The more the number of times a meme is shared, the more of an impact it has on culture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/grandpa-meme-image.jpg"                      alt="grandpa meme image"                ></p><h2 id="2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online"><a href="#2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online" class="headerlink" title="2. When did memes become a thing online?"></a>2. When did memes become a thing online?</h2><p>Memes, which originated as an idea conceived from an improbable source, have emerged as one of the key modes of communication that are used on the internet. Memes have almost completely taken over popular culture, and they can be found just about anywhere. Your favorite artist, a member of your family, or even a politician may be the one who spreads them. Anything, even humans, has the potential to spread virally and turn into a meme. If you get extremely lucky, becoming a meme can even make you famous.</p><p>At one point in time, many believed that memes were nothing more than strange visuals that certain portions of the internet created for their own amusement. They are now an integral element of the typical engagement that takes place on social media and are utilized, shared, and consumed on a minute-to-minute basis. They can take something as harmless as the children’s show Arthur and turn the visuals into something that causes the authors of the series to issue an apology, or they can make fun of the very idea of possessing a certain guitar model.</p><p>People’s lives are becoming increasingly influenced by the internet and various forms of social media, which has coincided with the proliferation of memes in popular culture. Memes have evolved into the ideal medium for disseminating knowledge, comedic content, and political viewpoints as the amount of time spent online continues to rise.

You don’t want to rely on methods that have since become obsolete. Do some research to find out what’s trending by looking through old memes. Also, pay attention to the memes that other people are posting wherever it is on the internet that you spend the majority of your time. It doesn’t matter if it’s Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.</p><p>Try to locate recent memes by browsing subreddits such as r&#x2F;memes and r&#x2F;dankmemes. In addition, there are times when a particular category of meme becomes popular. In that case, you should give those memes a shot and see if you can make them. For instance, Bernie Sanders was a topic of conversation for a few days not too long ago.</p><h2 id="5-Share-your-meme"><a href="#5-Share-your-meme" class="headerlink" title="5.

To review, you are now familiar with the process of creating a meme by either using a meme template that is blank so that you may add new meme captions or by making use of a screenshot tool to generate an entirely new meme.</p><p>If neither of these techniques works for you, another option is to use image editing software to generate new memes by uploading your own images or creating new memes from existing ones. When it comes to creating and distributing your very own memes, the number of options that are available to you is virtually limitless.

It helps in making the audial join smooth and avoids rough ends or disturbance in the output. Most commonly, fade effects are considered by professionals. In case you are using Premiere Pro and thinking of using the crossfade audio transition, you will have three options, such as –</p><p>● Constant power</p><p>● Constant gain</p><p>● Exponential fade</p><p>All these three options are leading to different effects. Now, it depends on the track and its nature and how it does it work on the video and audience. You should choose one option carefully. In case you want to add a quick effect of fade out and in, you should consider constant gain. The use of constant power will allow you to get a transition between both tracks without any gap or space lack. For slow fade out and in effects, you can go with the option of exponential fade. All these options will help you work out properly and make things much easier.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration"></a>Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/fade-out-music-pr-4.png"                      alt="Fade out by changing music duration "                ></p><p>Every time you may not feel the requirements of fade out and in settings of easy musical transition.

It helps in making the audial join smooth and avoids rough ends or disturbance in the output. Most commonly, fade effects are considered by professionals. In case you are using Premiere Pro and thinking of using the crossfade audio transition, you will have three options, such as –</p><p>● Constant power</p><p>● Constant gain</p><p>● Exponential fade</p><p>All these three options are leading to different effects. Now, it depends on the track and its nature and how it does it work on the video and audience. You should choose one option carefully. In case you want to add a quick effect of fade out and in, you should consider constant gain. The use of constant power will allow you to get a transition between both tracks without any gap or space lack. For slow fade out and in effects, you can go with the option of exponential fade. All these options will help you work out properly and make things much easier.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration-3"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration"></a>Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/fade-out-music-pr-4.png"                      alt="Fade out by changing music duration "                ></p><p>Every time you may not feel the requirements of fade out and in settings of easy musical transition.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Checklist-for-Starting-a-Live-Feed"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Checklist-for-Starting-a-Live-Feed" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Checklist for Starting a Live Feed"></a>The Ultimate Checklist for Starting a Live Feed</h2><p>In today’s day and age, over 59% of all marketing agencies are live streaming their content for the most reach. That is pretty simple why they jump into the live streaming businesses. There are also lots of brands and content creators just getting started, basically learning how to live stream that run into complicated situations. How do you plan it? How can you promote it the best way?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-a-live-stream.jpg"                      alt="make a live stream"                ></p><p>There are many different things to keep in mind and in this article, we will talk about every single one so you can get started creating successful live streams. There’s no problem with admitting that the technical side of live streaming is pretty complex and a little harder to understand, but with the right guide, you’ll get there!</p><p>Now you know the basics, let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What camera do you need?"></a>Part 1. What camera do you need?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, you can live stream from your phone or laptop’s camera, there are also good webcams available for not a lot of money. If you do have a budget a high-end camera, for example around $2000, you can invest in the following cameras:</p><p>Panasonic GH5<br>Sony A7 II<br>Panasonic LUMIX GH4</p><p>A camcorder or webcam will work perfectly for live streaming as long as the camera able to shoot at a minimum of 720p HD, 24fps. It’s totally fine to start off with the webcam on your laptop, or a better webcam. I have used the Logitech C922 for streaming and it works like a charm. The Mevo Plus helps you on great quality when you use a mobile device. After that you run your program into a software such as OBS where you can apply filters to improve your image, which you will be using to also live stream onto the actual platform such as YouTube or Twitch. A plus is that you don’t need a memory card for streaming as you’re not recording on the camera itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880956/19272" target="_top" id="1880956">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880956" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880956/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What microphone do you need?"></a>Part 2. What microphone do you need?</h2><p>When talking about audio, it’s one of the most important elements of your overall live stream. If people are getting frustrated trying to hear what you say, they are less likely to stay. Nowadays a lot of smartphones have amazing microphones with built-in noise cancellation and echo reduction. If you’re using a laptop or desktop, we recommend an external microphone as the webcam microphones aren’t that great.</p><p>USB microphones are the best choice for at-home streaming. Fanatics will rather use XLR microphones because of its sound quality. Good XLR microphones are a lot of the times way more expensive than regular USB microphones. XLRs also need an external sound card&#x2F;audio interface to be powered to your computer, like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, starting at around $130.</p><p>Budget microphones give you great streaming quality. The only downside is that they lack certain features like a mute button and voltage&#x2F;gain controls, which forces you to find another solution to make up for that such as using plugins in your streaming software to give more gain to your microphone and or use hotkeys to mute.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What streaming software do you need?"></a>Part 3. What streaming software do you need?</h2><p>The software you’ll be using to stream isn’t built into Windows, Mac, or any other operating systems by default. You first need to download a third-party streaming software.</p><p><strong>OBS</strong></p><p>OBS Studio is open-source software used for recording and streaming. It is free to download and use but misses some of the more advanced options that you see in paid programs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484950/16446" target="_top" id="1484950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484950/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are prepared to devote time to learning its functionality, OBS Studio has a lot more strength than most of the other free software, that’s why it is so popular under content creators. You will also find other plugins that people have created to add to OBS Studio’s functionality and flexibility to enhance your recording or streaming experience.</p><p><strong>Streamlabs</strong></p><p>Streamlabs was originally a live streaming tool that streamers use with other live streaming software together. Streamlabs OBS now combines the Streamlabs tool with OBS Studio, giving you a more in-depth streaming program with a more organized user interface. Just like OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS is free to download and use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs-desktop.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Nvidia ShadowPlay</strong></p><p>Nvidia ShadowPlay is designed for gamers and comes combined with Nvidia GeForce graphics cards. It allows people to stream high-quality livestreams and videos. It’s suitable for platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube and Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="nivdia shadowplay"                ></p><p>ShadowPlay’s DVR-style Instant Replay mode can be used by pressing a hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of your content to your hard drive or share to Twitch or YouTube. You can manually record videos for as long as you like because ShadowPlay is hardware accelerated. You can make up to a 15-second GIFs from your ShadowPlay video to ceate highlights, edit them afterwards with color grading effects, adding music, text, and upload it to Facebook, YouTube or Vimeo.</p><p><strong>XSplit Broadcaster</strong></p><p>XSplit Broadcaster is a recording and linve software for Windows. XSplit allows you to record and stream in 4K 60fps. You can use XSplit Broadcaster to stream on all platforms you can imagine that have a live function, you can even go live on multiple stream services at the same time. The streaming software has a lot of stream management features. There’s an option to edit scenes before starting your live stream with the Scene Preview Editor.</p><p>The ability to creative your own title and tags for ease of search is outstanding. The list of compatible technology that integrates with the software and the amount of data servers there are to help accommodate your needs while streaming, no matter if you are using ethernet or WiFi, XSplit is super easy to use for gaming, recording or podcasting.</p><p><strong>Wirecast</strong></p><p>What’s cool is that you can live stream from unlimited amount of sources. Microphones, cameras, IP cameras, and more. A built-in web-browser is able to show things such as web pages as well. You can mix up to 8 separate audio tracks and add processing combined with effects to enhance the viewer experience even more. Its powerful production capabilities make it super easy to switch back and forth between different live camera feeds while mixing in prerecorded video, graphics, audio, transitions and even slides.</p><p>Wirecast enables event organizers to comine live or pre-recorded video together with audio to achieve professional results as well as individual audio tracks for separate outputs. This program comes with a stock media library with videos, background images, music and more. Wirecast lets you stream like a pro and with its high-end features. This streaming software has multi-level audio recording, and 1-17 slot multi-viewer output for more advanced level of streaming and even ISO record assistance.</p><p><strong>VidBlasterX</strong></p><p>This is one of the high-end software systems with a built-in switcher and audio mixer. You can combine any number of floating input or output modules that can be positioned anywhere you want in the user interface. The modules can be docked to other ones to create the studio design that works best for you. It’s a huge benefit for having the most customization of all the 3rd party encoder apps you can use for live streaming.</p><p>The Home &amp; Studio editions comes with community support; the Broadcast edition comes with both priority and community support as well. The VidBlasterX Trial Edition is the same as the Studio Edition, with a watermark added to all output channels. The VidblasterX website tells: “VidBlasterX is a versatile and powerful ultra-low latency cascading vision mixer and video router with built-in scalers, time base correctors, frame synchronisers, IP video encoders and decoders, video players, recorders, keyers, effects and much more.”</p><p><strong>vMix</strong></p><p>This program also allows you to create professional quality videos and live shows. vMix offers you the power to add multiple cameras angles, images, videos, audio, titles, Powerpoint presentations, chroma key, virtual sets and even more than that. You are then able to showcase, live stream and record your content all at the same time. vMix integrates with EasyWorship, Flowplayer, Facebook, Restream, Vimeo, Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>That being said, vMix has excelled in great features and looks to be coming out with even more every six months. This program has added everything you need. Their integration of dedicated Call-In features together with NDI &amp; SRT support is clearly included and is available at a very affordable price. After all, we definitely recommend anyone wanting to move from a hardware solution to this kind of a software, to give vMix a try. Especially when they offer you a full 60-day Free Trial and it’s not a limited trial version either, but rather the whole top end version that includes everything you need to boost your live streaming career off the ground!</p><p><strong>Ffmpeg</strong></p><p>When talking about Ffmpeg, we’d like to mention that this is a very basic broadcasting software compatible with Dacast’s streaming platform. From what we noticed is that Ffmpeg is very easy and quick to learn where you won’t need to open another application in order to use it. As long as you’re happy with using the command line, you can use it for video and audio conversions, compression, and many other tools included in the options. We did use it to try at video editing, after using other paid software too, like VEGAS Pro. We do agree that it’s a matter of getting used to the program. You can find anything you need online to get started, or when you are lost. It’s good that it does not claim a lot of space on the hard drive. This is a complete new way of live streaming and video editing.</p><p><strong>Restream.io</strong></p><p>You likely have heard about this program. Restream is a complete and professional live streaming application for anyone who wants to start their online career professionally. Simply stream professional broadcasts from your browser to multiple social platforms at once, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. Customize your live streams, engage with your viewers, and drive action. They have a packed community of over 5,000,000 streamers using Restream to go broadcast live on YouTube, Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, and more!</p><p>The most significant of all features is the Ecamm Live integration. This allows you to read the chat of different platforms from the same place.

One of these is the second most visited website worldwide, which is YouTube. With this, people can communicate with each other and share thoughts by commenting and reacting to someone’s content or posts. In this composition, you will learn how to see YouTube liked comments. But first, let us define what YouTube is.</p><p>People can watch, like, share, comment on, and upload videos using the YouTube service. You can access this video service on PCs, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p><h2 id="What-Are-YouTube’s-Primary-Purposes"><a href="#What-Are-YouTube’s-Primary-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="What Are YouTube’s Primary Purposes?"></a>What Are YouTube’s Primary Purposes?</h2><ul><li>Users can look up and view videos.</li><li>Make your own YouTube channel.</li><li>movie clips to your channel</li><li>Share, like, and comment on other YouTube videos</li><li>Users can follow or subscribe to other YouTube channels.</li><li>To arrange videos and combine them together, make playlists.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Use-YouTube"><a href="#Why-Use-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Why Use YouTube?"></a>Why Use YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube is the second-largest web browser after Google. Every minute, YouTube receives more than 100 hours of video. Whether you’re disseminating information to students or marketing activities, it’s among the most significant ways to reach a large audience. Some of the benefits of YouTube are listed below.</p><p><strong>Your SEO may use some improvement</strong></p><p>One of the most widely used content types is video, frequently shared on social media. Sharing videos on YouTube with quality titles, descriptions, and tags is a terrific strategy to raise your search engine rating because Google and other search engines favor video content.</p><p><strong>Strong Branding</strong></p><p>Your brand messaging can be quickly and effectively communicated through video. Video is a beautiful medium for expressing the feeling and physical characteristics of your marketing because people respond positively to visual cues.</p><p><strong>Don’t Tell, Show</strong></p><p>Concepts that are difficult to express in word form can be effectively demonstrated through video: use screen capture recordings, live demonstrations, or even whiteboard drawings to present to your pupils.</p><p><strong>Reach a Greater Audience with Your Message</strong></p><p>YouTube is the world’s most widely used video site, and its videos are very shareable. Think about how frequently videos appear on your Twitter feed or Facebook Timeline. How often do you get emails with videos? Video may be easily and quickly shared widely.</p><p><strong>You don’t require a huge budget</strong></p><p>While hiring pros to make various sorts of videos has significant advantages, not all videos require a six-figure budget. With only a few pieces of essential video equipment, you may quickly and easily produce influential movies of lectures, demonstrations, and more.</p><p><strong>Mobile-Friendly Video</strong></p><p>Given how many students have smartphones, video is an excellent medium for connecting with them. Most students already use YouTube, which is particularly adapted for mobile devices.</p><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> Best YouTube Video Maker to Create Vlogs with Transitions and Effects.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/box-filmora-x.png"                                     > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-9-square.svg"                                     ></p><h2 id="How-to-See-Liked-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-See-Liked-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to See Liked Comments on YouTube?"></a>How to See Liked Comments on YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube is a service that is available for free, and it may be a terrific place for teenagers to find interest. Many young people use YouTube to watch comedy shows, how-to videos, recipes, hacks, and music videos. Teenagers also use the video-sharing platform to subscribe to other YouTubers and famous personalities and to follow their favorite vloggers (video bloggers).</p><p>If you create your own personal YouTube channel and upload your videos, people can like, share, and comment on your videos. You can also comment and like others’ comments on your video. Unfortunately, you can’t see who’s liked or disliked your comments on YouTube, but you can see reactions to your posts.</p><p>If you are still wondering why you can’t see who liked or disliked a Youtube comment, you should know these things:</p><ul><li>Neither you nor anyone else on YouTube can see who liked or disliked your comment.</li><li>YouTube hides users’ likes and dislikes of comments for their protection and security. Still, it’s probably safe to assume that everyone who made a favorable comment on your comment loved it.</li><li>You cannot see who viewed a particular video favorably or unfavorably, but you can see how many individuals did so.</li></ul><p>But, if you want to retrace the videos you commented on and the videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Click on your Google Account icon and find <strong>Your data in YouTube</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-your-data-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="find your data in youtube"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down a little bit and click the <strong>More</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-dashboard-more.jpg"                      alt="your youtube dashboard more"                ></p><p>Step3 Click the <strong>Comments</strong> section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-comments-your-youtube-dashboard.jpg"                      alt="click comments your youtube dashboard"                ></p><p>Now you will see your comment history, including the date when you commented on a certain video and also the exact comment you posted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-comments-date.jpg"                      alt="your youtube comments date"                ></p><p>To see videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, please follow these steps as continuation:</p><p>Step4 In the <strong>Google My Activity</strong> tab, click <strong>Other activity</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/other-activity-youtube-comments.jpg"                      alt="other activity youtube comments"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step5 Scroll down and find <strong>Comment Likes and Dislikes on YouTube</strong> section.

That is why there are just written numbers on the like button and on the dislike button there are none.</p><h2 id="How-to-Respond-to-Comments"><a href="#How-to-Respond-to-Comments" class="headerlink" title="How to Respond to Comments"></a>How to Respond to Comments</h2><p>Don’t ignore someone who has questioned you or written you a heartfelt note. Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise.

Many young people use YouTube to watch comedy shows, how-to videos, recipes, hacks, and music videos. Teenagers also use the video-sharing platform to subscribe to other YouTubers and famous personalities and to follow their favorite vloggers (video bloggers).</p><p>If you create your own personal YouTube channel and upload your videos, people can like, share, and comment on your videos. You can also comment and like others’ comments on your video. Unfortunately, you can’t see who’s liked or disliked your comments on YouTube, but you can see reactions to your posts.</p><p>If you are still wondering why you can’t see who liked or disliked a Youtube comment, you should know these things:</p><ul><li>Neither you nor anyone else on YouTube can see who liked or disliked your comment.</li><li>YouTube hides users’ likes and dislikes of comments for their protection and security. Still, it’s probably safe to assume that everyone who made a favorable comment on your comment loved it.</li><li>You cannot see who viewed a particular video favorably or unfavorably, but you can see how many individuals did so.</li></ul><p>But, if you want to retrace the videos you commented on and the videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Click on your Google Account icon and find <strong>Your data in YouTube</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-your-data-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="find your data in youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145009/26400" target="_top" id="2145009">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2145009" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145009/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Scroll down a little bit and click the <strong>More</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-dashboard-more.jpg"                      alt="your youtube dashboard more"                ></p><p>Step3 Click the <strong>Comments</strong> section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-comments-your-youtube-dashboard.jpg"                      alt="click comments your youtube dashboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now you will see your comment history, including the date when you commented on a certain video and also the exact comment you posted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-comments-date.jpg"                      alt="your youtube comments date"                ></p><p>To see videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, please follow these steps as continuation:</p><p>Step4 In the <strong>Google My Activity</strong> tab, click <strong>Other activity</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/other-activity-youtube-comments.jpg"                      alt="other activity youtube comments"                ></p><p>Step5 Scroll down and find <strong>Comment Likes and Dislikes on YouTube</strong> section.

Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise. Once you have read or replied to the comment, the highlight will go.</p><p>Additionally, video creators can manually highlight commenters to mark them for later responses. To do this, click on the comment’s timestamp (found next to the commenter’s username).
