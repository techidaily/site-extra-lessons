There are a seemingly limitless number of alternatives available, and your decision will have a significant impact on your photos. The introduction of mirrorless prompted the demand for lenses that matched the new formats.</p><p>Initially, while manufacturers like Canon, Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sony expanded their line of native lenses for those formats, photographers were dependent on adapters to fit legacy lenses from brands like Canon and Nikon to the APS-C, full-frame, and micro four-thirds mirrorless cameras. Additionally, independent lens producers like Sigma and Tamron continue to be crucial in supplying the demands of photographers looking for the greatest camera lens. Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens"><a href="#1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens" class="headerlink" title="1. What should you look for when buying a lens?"></a>1. What should you look for when buying a lens?</h2><p>There are a number of factors to think about while looking for the best camera lens. Knowing how you’ll use the lens is just as crucial as ensuring sure it’s available and compatible with your camera’s mount (or that an adapter is available). Are you trying to find the best portrait lens? Or perhaps you’re looking for the best lens for landscape photography. Or maybe you prefer taking pictures of little objects, in which case you’ll need a macro lens. There are (nearly) universal, all-encompassing circumstances, of course. Just keep in mind that neither the greatest lens for landscape photography nor the finest lens for astrophotography will inevitably be the ideal choice for macro photography.</p><p>Regardless of the lens you select, the effective focal length’s relationship to the sensor size is a crucial consideration. Because the sensor on full-frame cameras is the same size as a 35mm film strip, this is not a problem. However, you must consider the crop factor if you’re using an APS-C or micro four thirds camera. A 100mm lens will provide a field of view of 150mm when used with an APS-C camera, which will crop the frame by 1.5x or 1.6x (depending on the model) (35mm equivalent). It simply captures a smaller portion of the image produced by the lens, giving the impression that the image is zoomed in. The effective focal length will double with a micro four thirds sensor, giving a 100mm lens a 200mm (35mm equivalent) field of view. This is typically not an issue with telephoto lenses because you want a larger focal length, but it’s crucial to keep in mind with wide-angle lenses so make sure to conduct some calculations before choosing one.</p><p>The cost of a camera lens is affected by some aspects. A lens with a quicker (lower f-number) maximum aperture will cost more than one with f&#x2F;stops that start with a slower maximum aperture, such f&#x2F;3.5. For longer, heavier lenses, optical image stabilization—also known as SteadyShot, vibration reduction, or simply OIS or OS—is crucial. Invisible elements like the caliber of the glass, the kinds of coatings used on the surfaces, and the weather sealing are also important.</p><p>In the absence of other factors, some minor extras like the presence of a lens hood, a manual aperture ring, a carrying case, and other bonuses may influence your decision. but shouldn’t determine the outcome of your decision.</p><h2 id="2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses"><a href="#2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses" class="headerlink" title="2. What are some good and robust lenses?"></a>2. What are some good and robust lenses?</h2><p>Focal length is one of the most important factors for picking the best camera lens and producing a nice photo while taking portraits of individuals or even very small groups. Generally speaking, a short telephoto lens is good, especially for tight compositions (headshots, waist level&#x2F;head and shoulders, etc.)—an 85mm or 105mm, for instance. If you can’t back up and shoot wide, you might want to go as wide as 70mm or 50mm for full-body and larger group images in order to minimize distortion.</p><h3 id="Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S"></a><strong>Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S</strong></h3><p>The premium Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S lens, made for full-frame Nikon Z-series cameras, offers superb edge-to-edge sharpness for landscape photography. The aspherical lenses on the small lens are perfect for maintaining the sharpness of stars and city lights. Additionally, there are two ways to install filters: a slot for filter sheets and gels at the back and 112mm filters that may be screwed into the front.</p><p>Other choices for ultra-wide-angle lenses for full-frame cameras include the Sony FE 12-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 G Master. This camera lens is intriguing, albeit expensive, because it offers a little extra coverage starting at 12mm and maintains a consistent aperture throughout the zoom.</p><p>The 14–24mm f&#x2F;2.8 art series lens from Sigma is available in two variations. One is for DSLRs from Canon or Nikon, while the other is for mirrorless cameras from Sony and L-mount.</p><h3 id="Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8 is the first lens up, a costly manual focus prime lens with a small but devoted fan base. The only true bells and whistles this lens has are the “Zeiss” moniker, and I’m sure many photographers wonder if it lives up to the $1843 price tag in any other manner.</p><p>I must admit that I would never purchase this lens for myself, but to me, it does. Nevertheless, it is one of the sharpest wide angles I’ve ever tested, and unlike many of the other lenses on this list, it accepts filters (82mm size).</p><h3 id="Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3"><a href="#Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3"></a><strong>Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3</strong></h3><p>This 60-600mm super telephoto zoom is perfect for wildlife since it is wide enough to capture visitors to the bird feeder outside your back door or a pod of dolphins surfing the bow waves of a boat while still being long enough to capture the most elusive lioness and her pups on a picture safari. This image-stabilized lens, which is offered for Nikon, Canon, and Sigma, includes a tripod collar and is dust- and splash-proof.</p><p>The Sony FE 200-600mm f&#x2F;5.6 has Sony’s outstanding SteadyShot image stabilization, making it a great lens for Sony photographers. Although we typically advise zooms for wildlife photography, don’t discount some of the primes available. For instance, Canon’s EOS R mirrorless system is compatible with the Canon RF600mm f&#x2F;11 IS STM lens. Even though it only has an f&#x2F;11 maximum aperture, it should still function properly in well-lit environments.</p><p>Although you might need to increase the ISO to obtain a quick shutter speed, this lens is less expensive than other extreme telephoto lenses.</p><h3 id="Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4"><a href="#Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4" class="headerlink" title="Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4"></a><strong>Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4</strong></h3><p>For a couple reasons, I chose the lesser-known Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 lens over the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8. First, it costs half as much ($800) and is substantially lighter (719 vs. 1170 grams). These two elements alone make this lens more appealing to many photographers.</p><p>Second, the Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 has outstanding image quality. When I used it, I didn’t get a chance to directly compare it to the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, but I did evaluate how it performed when I photographed the Milky Way, which is likely the most demanding scenario. I accomplished this by comparing it to four other top 14mm lenses. With virtually no coma and perfect sharpness even when wide open, it defeated all of them.</p><p>This is a fantastic option for shooting landscapes in addition to stars. Although it lacks autofocus, the 14mm focal length makes it either the best or second-best lens on our list in terms of image quality. And once more, the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, which is the closest rival in that sense, is twice as expensive.</p><h3 id="Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8 is one of my favorite wide-angle lenses that I’ve ever used. Although it is weighty, the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 matches or even outperforms it in terms of overall image quality. It also comes with some contemporary features, such as vibration reduction and a front element that repels water. The telephoto range is where it loses some strength, like the Nikon (see our review), but even there it performs better than others.</p><p>The pricing is the actual incentive to get this lens instead. Additionally, there is a previous model with nearly comparable image quality that is available for even better used pricing. It costs $1200 new and even less used.</p><p>Tamron lenses don’t extend all the way to 14mm (closer to 15.5mm instead). Although the increase in focal length to 30mm is good, we believe that most of this lens’ potential customers would be more interested in the wide end of things. Additionally, similar to the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8, it doesn’t come with built-in filter support, so if that’s crucial to your photography, you’ll need a hefty attachment.</p><h3 id="Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4"><a href="#Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4"></a><strong>Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4</strong></h3><p>This lens is a recent addition to our list, and several people have asked why I didn’t include it in the comments. I’ve only lately had a chance to really test the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4, and I think it’s a great lens. First of all, it offers an excellent price of $600 and excellent image quality.</p><p>It is lightweight and has an f&#x2F;2.8 maximum aperture, making it ideal for astrophotography. This all comes together to provide a pretty remarkable package. In spite of the fact that corner sharpness isn’t nearly as good as it could be compared to certain other lenses on this list, the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4 doesn’t really have many drawbacks to speak about. But that’s hardly a criticism of this lens. It’s one of the first I’d look at if I needed a wide-angle zoom for a Nikon.</p><h3 id="Nikon-20mm-f-1-8"><a href="#Nikon-20mm-f-1-8" class="headerlink" title="Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8"></a><strong>Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8</strong></h3><p>It is sharper than all of the zooms on this list at 20mm, with the possible exception of the 14-30mm f&#x2F;4. And assuming you don’t require the 14mm focal length for your Milky Way work, it’s better than practically every lens above for astrophotography thanks to its f&#x2F;1.8 aperture.</p><h2 id="3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime"><a href="#3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime" class="headerlink" title="3. What lenses are good for nighttime?"></a>3. What lenses are good for nighttime?</h2><p>Most photographers find nighttime photography challenging because this particular shooting circumstance frequently depends on your lens’ capacity to pick up light. abundant light As a result, investing in the ideal equipment that makes the most of any available ambient light and illuminates your entire frame is essential for success.</p><p>Here is our list on the top nighttime camera lenses to help you capture the darkest of scenes.</p><h3 id="Canon-EF-24-70mm-f-2-8L-II-USM"><a href="#Canon-EF-24-70mm-f-2-8L-II-USM" class="headerlink" title="Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM"></a><strong>Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM</strong></h3><p>For general photography, one of the greatest lenses is the Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM. This has an excellent build quality and a quick f&#x2F;2.8 aperture, which are its biggest advantages.</p><p>This focus range, also known as the “walk-around lens,” may be used to shoot whatever you could possibly want, including tight portraits and landscapes. The f&#x2F;1.8 lenses that we described at the beginning of this post are one stop slower than f&#x2F;2.8. However, the Canon 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II has a number of qualities that make it a fantastic lens for shooting in low light.</p><h3 id="Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens"><a href="#Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens"></a><strong>Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens</strong></h3><p>Amazing glass is the Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens. With a maximum aperture of f&#x2F;1.2, the widest an autofocusing lens can go, it offers excellent results. Since the lens includes a floating mechanism, focusing up close as well as throughout the remainder of the focusing range will be simple.</p><p>One “F” Low Dispersion Element, also known as a FLD element, and four Super-Low Dispersion glass elements make up the lens. This substance functions very similarly to a fluorite coating. There are also two spherical components. Together, these components make sure that chromatic aberration and distortion are minimized in the lens.</p><p>The lens also features a Super-Multi-Layer coating on top of it. This reduces flares and ghosting while enhancing the image’s sharpness and saturation. The Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.4 DG HSM Art lens is available for DSLR cameras, although it is only available for mirrorless systems.</p><h3 id="Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens"><a href="#Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens"></a><strong>Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens</strong></h3><p>The Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens is the last item on our list, but surely not the least! The G-Master is your best pal if you own a Sony mirrorless camera. The most expensive lenses you can purchase directly from Sony are in their GM range, which includes the well-liked Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens.</p><p>This lens’s wide focal length and fantastic f&#x2F;1.8 aperture make it a handy tool for astrophotography. Edge-to- edge sharpness means that the stars you photograph in the corners of the frame will be just as sharp as those that appear in the center of the picture.</p><p>Sharpness is second nature to this GM lens. Neon fringing can be prevented from occurring in the areas of your image that are contrasted by having good chromatic aberration management. This one feels quite cozy in your palm because to the ergonomic lens design.</p><h3 id="Nikon-AF-Nikkor-50mm-f-1-8D"><a href="#Nikon-AF-Nikkor-50mm-f-1-8D" class="headerlink" title="Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8D"></a><strong>Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8D</strong></h3><p>Among Nikonians, the Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 F-mount lens is a perennial favorite. This 50mm prime lens has an f&#x2F;1.8 maximum wide aperture. The lens has an aperture ring, a focus distance indication, and a manual focus ring.Flares and ghosting are handled by the lens’ Super Integrated Coating. The 50mm is versatile since it has a physical ring that regulates the aperture and a manual focusing ring.</p><h2 id="4-What-are-good-micro-lenses"><a href="#4-What-are-good-micro-lenses" class="headerlink" title="4. What are good micro lenses?"></a>4. What are good micro lenses?</h2><p>Using the best macro lenses, photographers can make a little world full of hidden beauty visible. Macro lenses provide close-ups and magnification that would not be feasible without their specialized optical design, opening up a wide range of photographic opportunities for teeny-tiny plants and animals</p><p>Additionally, macro lenses aren’t just useful for this; they also make great prime lenses in general and work especially well for portrait photography. You are purchasing more than just the capacity to photograph close-ups when you take into account the price tags of these lenses.</p><h3 id="Canon-EF-100mm-f-2-8L-Macro-IS-USM"><a href="#Canon-EF-100mm-f-2-8L-Macro-IS-USM" class="headerlink" title="Canon EF 100mm f&#x2F;2.8L Macro IS USM"></a><strong>Canon EF 100mm f&#x2F;2.8L Macro IS USM</strong></h3><p>Canon’s 100mm macro lens has hybrid optical stabilization in addition to the strong L-series build quality. Ring- type ultrasonic autofocus and a three-position autofocus limiter switch, which can shut off the short or long end of the range, are typical high-end attractions.</p><p>The lens also contains an Ultra-low Dispersion element and weather sealing. Even at f&#x2F;22, image quality is superb throughout the whole aperture range, allowing you to squeeze out a bit extra depth of field. For the majority of macro photography, the manual focus ring is more crucial than the autofocus since it is smooth and precise.</p><h3 id="Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro"><a href="#Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro" class="headerlink" title="Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro"></a><strong>Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro</strong></h3><p>The AT-X PRO 100mm macro lens from Tokina was introduced back in 2006. In 2019, the replacement atx-i (interactive) model hit the market with a new design that gives the lens a more modern appearance. However, appearances can be deceiving, because the newcomer uses the same optical path with two aspherical and two Super-Low Dispersion glass elements as the original.</p><p>The fact that only the Canon mount version includes an autofocus motor and that it has an expanding inner barrel that extends longer at closer focusing distances are other similarities. The image quality is excellent, with outstanding sharpness levels, little distortion, and barely detectable lateral chromatic aberration.</p><h3 id="Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S"></a><strong>Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S</strong></h3><p>One of two new Z-mount macro lenses is the MC 105mm from Nikon. There is also the more affordable Z MC 50mm f&#x2F;2.8, which is a good lens, but the MC 105mm has a better macro photography focal length and is a pro-grade lens, so it’s well worth the extra money.</p><p>A super-fast and very accurate autofocus mechanism, together with highly effective optical VR (Vibration Reduction) that can function in conjunction with the in - body stabilizers of Nikon’s full-frame Z-series cameras, provide sublime image quality for both general shooting and extreme close-ups. A multi-function OLED display, a lens-function button and control ring that can be customized, an autofocus range limiter, as well as an electronically connected focus ring that permits ultra-fine adjustments, are all features of the handling exotica camera.</p><h3 id="Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro"><a href="#Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro" class="headerlink" title="Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro"></a><strong>Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro</strong></h3><p>This is Nikon’s top-tier FX format macro lens, yet it also works well with DX cameras when photographing up close. It has a ring-type ultrasonic autofocus mechanism with entirely internal focusing, 3-stop VR II stabilization, and Nano Crystal coating, just like the 85mm DX lens in the group. The optical pathways of both lenses have 14 elements total, including one ED element.</p><p>The 105mm has a greater diameter because FX format lenses must produce a larger image circle to cover the larger picture sensor. At the minimum focus setting, the working distance between the front of the lens and the subject is fairly similar to the DX lens at 14.5cm. Similar to the Sigma lens, the VR system is effective for usual shooting, although it performs less well for close-up shots than the hybrid stabilizers from Tamron and Canon.</p><h2 id="5-What-are-the-price-ranges"><a href="#5-What-are-the-price-ranges" class="headerlink" title="5. What are the price ranges?"></a>5. What are the price ranges?</h2><p>The price of a camera lens varies depending on the lens’s quality. Beginner camera lenses range in price from $100 to $400. The typical price of a camera lens ranges from $500 to $11,000 for professional photographers, while lenses cost between $200 and $700 for intermediate and advanced enthusiasts.</p><h3 id="Beginners"><a href="#Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Beginners"></a><strong>Beginners</strong></h3><p>Lenses for cameras might be pricey, but they don’t have to be. When you first begin taking photographs, there’s no need to invest in more lenses than you actually require. We’ll start by examining the most reasonably priced lenses.</p><p>They won’t score the highest on those technical tests, but they’ll nonetheless produce fantastic pictures for a beginning photographer. Here are some examples of entry-level lens prices, which range from an average of $100 to $400.</p><h3 id="Intermediates"><a href="#Intermediates" class="headerlink" title="Intermediates"></a><strong>Intermediates</strong></h3><p>Intermediate photographers have higher expectations for image quality and features than starting photographers, who are more like casual shooters. You’ll pay a little more than the entry-level lenses, but not significantly more than for the better lenses. Here are some samples of typical lens pricing for advanced hobbyist photographers between $200 and $700.</p><h3 id="Professionals"><a href="#Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Professionals"></a><strong>Professionals</strong></h3><p>Even if you’re not a professional photographer and don’t shoot for hire, you might still desire the highest possible image quality. You ought to purchase professional lenses if your money permits. Pro lenses are the most expensive, offer the highest level of image quality, and frequently have the largest maximum lens apertures. You can see examples of camera lens prices for the lenses used by professional photographers in the table below.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The price of a camera lens varies greatly and depends on your needs as a photographer.

How can you promote it the best way?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-a-live-stream.jpg"                      alt="make a live stream"                ></p><p>There are many different things to keep in mind and in this article, we will talk about every single one so you can get started creating successful live streams. There’s no problem with admitting that the technical side of live streaming is pretty complex and a little harder to understand, but with the right guide, you’ll get there!</p><p>Now you know the basics, let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What camera do you need?"></a>Part 1. What camera do you need?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, you can live stream from your phone or laptop’s camera, there are also good webcams available for not a lot of money. If you do have a budget a high-end camera, for example around $2000, you can invest in the following cameras:</p><p>Panasonic GH5<br>Sony A7 II<br>Panasonic LUMIX GH4</p><p>A camcorder or webcam will work perfectly for live streaming as long as the camera able to shoot at a minimum of 720p HD, 24fps. It’s totally fine to start off with the webcam on your laptop, or a better webcam. I have used the Logitech C922 for streaming and it works like a charm. The Mevo Plus helps you on great quality when you use a mobile device. After that you run your program into a software such as OBS where you can apply filters to improve your image, which you will be using to also live stream onto the actual platform such as YouTube or Twitch. A plus is that you don’t need a memory card for streaming as you’re not recording on the camera itself.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What microphone do you need?"></a>Part 2. What microphone do you need?</h2><p>When talking about audio, it’s one of the most important elements of your overall live stream. If people are getting frustrated trying to hear what you say, they are less likely to stay. Nowadays a lot of smartphones have amazing microphones with built-in noise cancellation and echo reduction. If you’re using a laptop or desktop, we recommend an external microphone as the webcam microphones aren’t that great.</p><p>USB microphones are the best choice for at-home streaming. Fanatics will rather use XLR microphones because of its sound quality. Good XLR microphones are a lot of the times way more expensive than regular USB microphones. XLRs also need an external sound card&#x2F;audio interface to be powered to your computer, like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, starting at around $130.</p><p>Budget microphones give you great streaming quality. The only downside is that they lack certain features like a mute button and voltage&#x2F;gain controls, which forces you to find another solution to make up for that such as using plugins in your streaming software to give more gain to your microphone and or use hotkeys to mute.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What streaming software do you need?"></a>Part 3. What streaming software do you need?</h2><p>The software you’ll be using to stream isn’t built into Windows, Mac, or any other operating systems by default. You first need to download a third-party streaming software.</p><p><strong>OBS</strong></p><p>OBS Studio is open-source software used for recording and streaming. It is free to download and use but misses some of the more advanced options that you see in paid programs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>If you are prepared to devote time to learning its functionality, OBS Studio has a lot more strength than most of the other free software, that’s why it is so popular under content creators. You will also find other plugins that people have created to add to OBS Studio’s functionality and flexibility to enhance your recording or streaming experience.</p><p><strong>Streamlabs</strong></p><p>Streamlabs was originally a live streaming tool that streamers use with other live streaming software together. Streamlabs OBS now combines the Streamlabs tool with OBS Studio, giving you a more in-depth streaming program with a more organized user interface. Just like OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS is free to download and use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs-desktop.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><p><strong>Nvidia ShadowPlay</strong></p><p>Nvidia ShadowPlay is designed for gamers and comes combined with Nvidia GeForce graphics cards. It allows people to stream high-quality livestreams and videos. It’s suitable for platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube and Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="nivdia shadowplay"                ></p><p>ShadowPlay’s DVR-style Instant Replay mode can be used by pressing a hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of your content to your hard drive or share to Twitch or YouTube. You can manually record videos for as long as you like because ShadowPlay is hardware accelerated. You can make up to a 15-second GIFs from your ShadowPlay video to ceate highlights, edit them afterwards with color grading effects, adding music, text, and upload it to Facebook, YouTube or Vimeo.</p><p><strong>XSplit Broadcaster</strong></p><p>XSplit Broadcaster is a recording and linve software for Windows. XSplit allows you to record and stream in 4K 60fps. You can use XSplit Broadcaster to stream on all platforms you can imagine that have a live function, you can even go live on multiple stream services at the same time. The streaming software has a lot of stream management features. There’s an option to edit scenes before starting your live stream with the Scene Preview Editor.</p><p>The ability to creative your own title and tags for ease of search is outstanding. The list of compatible technology that integrates with the software and the amount of data servers there are to help accommodate your needs while streaming, no matter if you are using ethernet or WiFi, XSplit is super easy to use for gaming, recording or podcasting.</p><p><strong>Wirecast</strong></p><p>What’s cool is that you can live stream from unlimited amount of sources. Microphones, cameras, IP cameras, and more. A built-in web-browser is able to show things such as web pages as well. You can mix up to 8 separate audio tracks and add processing combined with effects to enhance the viewer experience even more. Its powerful production capabilities make it super easy to switch back and forth between different live camera feeds while mixing in prerecorded video, graphics, audio, transitions and even slides.</p><p>Wirecast enables event organizers to comine live or pre-recorded video together with audio to achieve professional results as well as individual audio tracks for separate outputs. This program comes with a stock media library with videos, background images, music and more. Wirecast lets you stream like a pro and with its high-end features. This streaming software has multi-level audio recording, and 1-17 slot multi-viewer output for more advanced level of streaming and even ISO record assistance.</p><p><strong>VidBlasterX</strong></p><p>This is one of the high-end software systems with a built-in switcher and audio mixer. You can combine any number of floating input or output modules that can be positioned anywhere you want in the user interface. The modules can be docked to other ones to create the studio design that works best for you. It’s a huge benefit for having the most customization of all the 3rd party encoder apps you can use for live streaming.</p><p>The Home &amp; Studio editions comes with community support; the Broadcast edition comes with both priority and community support as well. The VidBlasterX Trial Edition is the same as the Studio Edition, with a watermark added to all output channels. The VidblasterX website tells: “VidBlasterX is a versatile and powerful ultra-low latency cascading vision mixer and video router with built-in scalers, time base correctors, frame synchronisers, IP video encoders and decoders, video players, recorders, keyers, effects and much more.”</p><p><strong>vMix</strong></p><p>This program also allows you to create professional quality videos and live shows. vMix offers you the power to add multiple cameras angles, images, videos, audio, titles, Powerpoint presentations, chroma key, virtual sets and even more than that. You are then able to showcase, live stream and record your content all at the same time. vMix integrates with EasyWorship, Flowplayer, Facebook, Restream, Vimeo, Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>That being said, vMix has excelled in great features and looks to be coming out with even more every six months. This program has added everything you need. Their integration of dedicated Call-In features together with NDI &amp; SRT support is clearly included and is available at a very affordable price. After all, we definitely recommend anyone wanting to move from a hardware solution to this kind of a software, to give vMix a try. Especially when they offer you a full 60-day Free Trial and it’s not a limited trial version either, but rather the whole top end version that includes everything you need to boost your live streaming career off the ground!</p><p><strong>Ffmpeg</strong></p><p>When talking about Ffmpeg, we’d like to mention that this is a very basic broadcasting software compatible with Dacast’s streaming platform. From what we noticed is that Ffmpeg is very easy and quick to learn where you won’t need to open another application in order to use it. As long as you’re happy with using the command line, you can use it for video and audio conversions, compression, and many other tools included in the options. We did use it to try at video editing, after using other paid software too, like VEGAS Pro. We do agree that it’s a matter of getting used to the program. You can find anything you need online to get started, or when you are lost. It’s good that it does not claim a lot of space on the hard drive. This is a complete new way of live streaming and video editing.</p><p><strong>Restream.io</strong></p><p>You likely have heard about this program. Restream is a complete and professional live streaming application for anyone who wants to start their online career professionally. Simply stream professional broadcasts from your browser to multiple social platforms at once, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. Customize your live streams, engage with your viewers, and drive action.

This allows you to read the chat of different platforms from the same place. The video quality that Restream employs is the best with barely any latency and delay!</p><h2 id="Wrapping-it-up"><a href="#Wrapping-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping it up"></a>Wrapping it up</h2><p>Live streaming is quite a wide topic, and each streaming experience is different as well. We made this article to give you a very neutral feel how to go live stream. Understanding the basics together with some test runs and practice will help make your live streams way more better and valuable for the viewers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/exclusive-selection-best-5-free-convertors-for-video-from-gifs/"><u>Exclusive Selection  Best 5 Free Convertors for Video From GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/analyzing-time-of-playback-in-a-20mb-film-for-2024/"><u>Analyzing Time of Playback in a 20Mb Film for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/androids-power-to-replay-film-slices/"><u>Android's Power to Replay Film Slices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-airborne-ingenuity-sections/"><u>In 2024, Airborne Ingenuity Sections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/unlocking-snapchats-spotlight-mechanics/"><u>Unlocking Snapchat's Spotlight Mechanics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/flip-the-script-ios-method-to-reverse-vids/"><u>Flip the Script  IOS Method to Reverse Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/iphone-hdr-excellence-comprehensive-tutorial/"><u>IPhone HDR Excellence  Comprehensive Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/ideal-windows-podcast-software-selections/"><u>Ideal Windows Podcast Software Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/all-must-knows-to-use-fake-gps-go-location-spoofer-on-oppo-a79-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>All Must-Knows to Use Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer On Oppo A79 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mastery-in-media-manipulation-ttml-and-xml-for-superior-srt-outputs-for-2024/"><u>Mastery in Media Manipulation  TTML & XML for Superior SRT Outputs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-itops-expert-selection-best-windows-screencasters/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  ITop's Expert Selection  Best Windows Screencasters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/streamlined-process-adding-youtube-videos-into-slate-decks/"><u>Streamlined Process  Adding YouTube Videos Into Slate Decks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-embedded-recorder-usage-in-huaweis-mate-series-and-the-p-lineup/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Embedded Recorder Usage in Huawei's Mate Series and the P Lineup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-navigating-twitters-video-content-aspect-ratios-included-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigating Twitter’s Video Content  Aspect Ratios Included for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-leading-lines-crafting-images-on-iphones/"><u>[Updated] The Art of Leading Lines  Crafting Images on iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-music-mashups-for-windows-11-clips/"><u>[Updated] Music Mashups for Windows 11 Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-increase-viewership-quickly-smart-streaming-across-platforms-like-youtube-and-twitch/"><u>2024 Approved  Increase Viewership Quickly  Smart Streaming Across Platforms Like Youtube and Twitch</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Thanks to the acronyms, many people are becoming confused as to how each differs. Hopefully the following information will clear that up for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/difference-between-vr-ar-mr.jpg"                      alt="difference between VR AR MR"                ></p><h2 id="About-VR"><a href="#About-VR" class="headerlink" title="About VR"></a>About VR</h2><p> VR stands for Virtual Reality which basically means that it is able to draw the user into an immersive simulation. The real environment can be totally replaced with the sounds and sights giving you the feel as though you are actually present in the digital world and part of it.</p><ul><li>Features</li></ul><p> To enhance the experience and make virtual reality exciting headsets and cameras are often used to block out the real world. It’s a totally immersive experience allowing you to interact with a totally different world.</p><ul><li>Platform</li></ul><p> VR has already been used to help with training medical staff and military as well as in gaming to give an experience on a totally different level. More recently virtual reality has stepped up to the next level offering users a more realistic experience to lose themselves in.</p><ul><li>Headset</li></ul><p> By using a headset people are able to walk around their own surroundings yet feel as though they are in a totally different place to their reality. They can interact with other users in games and digital characters without the outside world interrupting.</p><ul><li>Prospect</li></ul><p> Flight and scenario simulation has already been able to utilize virtual reality as a tool for training without actually having to be in a real life situation. In the gaming world it takes people out of their real world and gives them a totally different experience. 360 degree videos have often been confused with virtual reality however because there is no interaction and the scenario has been prerecorded it is not thought to be in the same category. Although virtual reality has been around a long time it is still a great way to escape from the real world altogether and be totally immersed in another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-reality.jpg"                      alt="virtual-reality"                ></p><h2 id="About-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#About-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="About Augmented Reality"></a>About Augmented Reality</h2><ul><li>Features</li></ul><p> AR stands for augmented reality which is a way that you can get an indirect view of a real life scenario or environment in a supplemented way by use of digital technology. A great example of this would be being an empty room yet being able to use digital technology to see how it would look in a different color with different furnishings before actually purchasing them. Sound graphics and other sensory input can help to make the experience more realistic.</p><ul><li>Platform</li></ul><p> Although the digital and other augmented parts of the augmented reality are superimposed in real life they are not actually part of it. It can be used to interact with the real world to help make suggestions of improvement such as recipe ideas based on real ingredients laid out before the camera.</p><ul><li>Headset</li></ul><p> A headset is able to enhance the experience further, such as adding characters in a game that are able to talk and make suggestions, immersing you in part to give you the feel of realism. Augmented reality can be best described as a real life overlay rather than a thorough digital and sensory experience that takes you away from it.</p><ul><li>Prospect</li></ul><p> We are already seeing augmented reality being used to day in real life situations such as training. It is also being used in gaming and more recently with mobile technology using GPS signals to add more realism and accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/augmented-reality.jpg"                      alt="augmented-reality"                ></p><h2 id="About-MR"><a href="#About-MR" class="headerlink" title="About MR"></a>About MR</h2><ul><li>Features</li></ul><p> MR stands for mixed reality which brings the digital world and real world together to bring you a totally new experience. Rather than just being added to the real world the experiences instead are interactive to a point where they can be used in many applications. Characters and scenarios can be mixed real world surroundings.</p><ul><li>Platform</li></ul><p> Mixed reality allows you to get a better sense of realism as the digital scenarios take place in the real world surroundings. This can be used in training and in gaming technology.</p><ul><li>Headset</li></ul><p> Using a headset allows for a better sense of realism, however it as it is a mixed reality not all scenarios would be suitable for headset use if you still wish to interact with others who are physically present.

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $72TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money.

They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Price Recommendations"></a>Part 2: Best Price Recommendations</h2><p>Here we recommend the cloud storage services with the best prices in three categories.</p><h3 id="1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage"><a href="#1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage" class="headerlink" title="1.

Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><strong>#1. Sync.com</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><strong>#2. IceDrive</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><strong>#3. Google Drive</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free" class="headerlink" title="2.

TeraBox also guarantees ISO&#x2F;IEC-certified cloud security and offers “Locked Box” functionality for private cloud storage.</p><h3 id="3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest"><a href="#3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest" class="headerlink" title="3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?"></a>3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><strong>#2. IceDrive</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><strong>#3.

Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

TeraBox also guarantees ISO&#x2F;IEC-certified cloud security and offers “Locked Box” functionality for private cloud storage.</p><h3 id="3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest-1"><a href="#3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?"></a>3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

How do they work? In this article, we’ll explain exactly how these new modes work and how they can be used to make your photographs look better than ever before.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Smart HDR 4 (iPhone 13)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Smart HDR 3 (iPhone 12)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Smart HDR (iPhone 11)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Auto HDR (iPhone X)</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-the-HDR-Feature-for-iPhone-Photos"><a href="#What-is-the-HDR-Feature-for-iPhone-Photos" class="headerlink" title="What is the HDR Feature for iPhone Photos?"></a>What is the HDR Feature for iPhone Photos?</h2><p>HDR is a feature that allows you to take better photos in low-light situations and at night. It works by taking multiple pictures at different exposures and then combining them into one photo. This results in a photo with more detail and less noise.</p><p>Because of computational photography, the iPhone automatically adjusts color, sunlight, contrast, skin, saturation, and background blur.</p><p>The iPhone has had this feature for a few years now and it keeps getting better with every new release.</p><h2 id="Camera-Comparison-Different-Versions-of-Smart-HDR-Vs-Previous-HDR-in-iPhone"><a href="#Camera-Comparison-Different-Versions-of-Smart-HDR-Vs-Previous-HDR-in-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Camera Comparison: Different Versions of Smart HDR Vs Previous HDR in iPhone"></a>Camera Comparison: Different Versions of Smart HDR Vs Previous HDR in iPhone</h2><p>When you compare the latest Smart HDR technology used in iPhone to the prior HDR, Smart HDR wins in every aspect. From giving your photos better color to enhancing their highlights and shadow details.

The feature has been upgraded with a new algorithm to create more natural-looking images by removing some of the artifacts that have been found in previous iterations of the technology.</p><ul><li>The beautiful photographs taken on iPhones have to do with the quality of its HDR and Deep Fusion features.</li><li>In HDR 3 we can find a wider aperture and improved low-light performance.

With Smart HDR features, your camera will take buffer frames,</p><ul><li>where you’ll need to tap the shutter before and after, that capture images in different exposures so that your iPhone will capture everything, even highlights, shadows, and background objects.</li><li>Newer models of iPhone, equipped with Apple’s A12 Bionic chip, have Smart HDR, which automatically adjusts the dynamic range by employing AI technology.</li><li>If you’re looking to use HDR for any type of photo, use your photos with a significant amount of high contrast with dramatic, meaningful light or shadow contrast and be sure to keep your camera as steady as possible to get the best results.</li><li>Smart HDR can vastly improve your photos without you doing anything different.</li><li>It seems to use both an image sensor and a depth map from its TrueDepth camera setup.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-4.jpg"                      alt="smart hdr"                ></p><h3 id="Auto-HDR-iPhone-X"><a href="#Auto-HDR-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="Auto HDR (iPhone X)"></a>Auto HDR (iPhone X)</h3><p>Auto HDR is a feature in the camera of the iPhone X series that takes multiple pictures at different exposures and then combines them to create one well-exposed photo. One of the things that make the iPhone camera so great is computational photography.</p><p>This feature is designed to improve the quality of your photos by automatically applying a high dynamic range (HDR) effect. Here are five benefits of using Auto HDR on your iPhone</p><ul><li>You can avoid editing your photos in post-processing, which saves time and reduces the risk of errors;</li><li>Auto HDR applies different levels of saturation and contrast depending on what you’re photographing, giving you more accurate colors;</li><li>It uses face detection to properly expose portraits; -</li><li>It improves details in low light situations; and</li><li>It’s enabled by default in iOS 11 so you don’t have to do anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-5.jpg"                      alt="auto hdr"                ></p><h2 id="Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14"><a href="#Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?"></a>Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?</h2><p>The rumor mill is generating leaks about a possible new 48 MP main sensor for the next-generation iPhone 14 Pro camera.

It works by taking multiple pictures at different exposures and then combining them into one photo. This results in a photo with more detail and less noise.</p><p>Because of computational photography, the iPhone automatically adjusts color, sunlight, contrast, skin, saturation, and background blur.</p><p>The iPhone has had this feature for a few years now and it keeps getting better with every new release.</p><h2 id="Camera-Comparison-Different-Versions-of-Smart-HDR-Vs-Previous-HDR-in-iPhone-1"><a href="#Camera-Comparison-Different-Versions-of-Smart-HDR-Vs-Previous-HDR-in-iPhone-1" class="headerlink" title="Camera Comparison: Different Versions of Smart HDR Vs Previous HDR in iPhone"></a>Camera Comparison: Different Versions of Smart HDR Vs Previous HDR in iPhone</h2><p>When you compare the latest Smart HDR technology used in iPhone to the prior HDR, Smart HDR wins in every aspect.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-SFPR-Settings-to-Boost-Sluggish-Clips"><a href="#Best-SFPR-Settings-to-Boost-Sluggish-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Best SFPR Settings to Boost Sluggish Clips"></a>Best SFPR Settings to Boost Sluggish Clips</h2><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography. Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><h2 id="1-60-fps"><a href="#1-60-fps" class="headerlink" title="1. 60 fps"></a>1. 60 fps</h2><p>Anything higher than 30 fps is for creating slow-motion videos. 60 fps is the standard slow motion frame rate for Hollywood movies. You must have come across scenes where the superhero walks out slowly in a dramatic manner. Such scenes are shot at 60fps and displayed at 24 or 30 fps. Besides, this frame rate is suitable for capturing character’s emotions as well.</p><p>Basically, you should use 60 fps when the action is already slow. Some examples are someone walking out of an action sequence, blowing off candles, or getting dressed. Shooting video at 60fps enhances the smoothness of the action. The visuals look more detailed and real. That is why people shoot 4K videos at 60fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for any action that is already slow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="60 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-120-fps"><a href="#2-120-fps" class="headerlink" title="2. 120 fps"></a>2. 120 fps</h2><p>Let us assume that you are shooting at 120 fps and displaying at 30 fps. The video will play 4 times slower than it is in real life. The slow-motion effect will be two times slower than shooting at 60fps. If you shoot slow action at 120 fps, the output will be unusually slow and visually unpleasant. Therefore, you should shoot fast action scenes at 120 fps.</p><p>Some of the examples are someone running, playing slow sports, or drifting a car. You will find professionals using 120 fps for showing the slow-motion football kick and baseball bat swing. The scene will come out super smooth and visually crisp. 120 fps is widely used in the gaming industry for fast-paced action games.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast-paced action and fast moving subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/120-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="120 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="3-180-fps"><a href="#3-180-fps" class="headerlink" title="3. 180 fps"></a>3. 180 fps</h2><p>The scenes that are suitable for 120 fps are also suitable for 180 fps. This means you can shoot fast-moving subjects, objects, and elements. Some of the examples are horse riding, subject running, riding a bike, and likewise. But when you shoot at 180 fps, your objective is to show down the action much further.</p><p>This means that a scene shot at 180 fps will look slower than at 120 fps. You must have seen scenes where an object in motion is slowed down and zoomed in for detail. Such scenes are perfect for 180 frame rate. You may not achieve super slow mow scenes but it is going to be somewhere near that.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast moving action with emphasis on slow downing motion further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/180-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="180 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="4-240-fps"><a href="#4-240-fps" class="headerlink" title="4. 240 fps"></a>4. 240 fps</h2><p>When you are capturing an action that is too fast for your eyes to see, you should use 240 fps. For example, when you are watching a fast-paced sports event, your eyes cannot capture all movements. When you capture those scenes at 240 fps, the output video will look more comfortable for the eyes. The use of 240 fps is very popular in sports like cricket.</p><p>The broadcasters show replays in slow motion by capturing bat and ball strikes at 240 fps. You will also come across videos like slow mow water splashes that are shot at 240 fps. In action movies, you can see the hero punching the villain in the face. Then the scene shows the impact of the punch on the face with skin and muscle getting shattered. Such scenes are perfectly shot at 240 fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for action that are too fast for the eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/240-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="240 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="5-480-fps"><a href="#5-480-fps" class="headerlink" title="5. 480 fps"></a>5. 480 fps</h2><p>If you want super slow motion video, you have to shoot at 480 fps. The 480 frame rate is considered to be the base of super slow motion. There are higher frame rates available for more enhanced super slow-motion videos. When you shoot at 480 fps, the video will play 16 times slower. This is usual in showcasing extremely fast movements.</p><p>For example, when you are shooting with a gun, the bullet goes out at lightning speed. You will need 480 fps to capture the scene of the bullet coming out of the gun and show it in extremely slow motion. Some other scenarios are slicing a vegetable with a knife, dropping a water-filled balloon on the floor, or performing skateboard skills. All such scenarios should be shot at 480 fps for super slow video output.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting extremely fast actions and show in super slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/480-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="480 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no definite answer to which is the best frame rate for slow motion. It completely depends on what you are shooting. Yes, it is true that 60 fps is the standard slow motion fps. But 60 fps is only suitable when the action is low as well. Different frame rates are suitable for different scenes. The faster the action you are shooting, the higher should be the frame rate. For smooth super slow motion video, you should consider shooting at 480 fps. Frame rate beyond 480 is suitable for capturing slow-motion explosion videos.</p><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography.

We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-behind-the-scenes-crafting-a-movie-blueprint/"><u>In 2024, Behind the Scenes  Crafting a Movie Blueprint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-animatedapp-full-guide-24-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  AnimatedApp Full Guide '24 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-boost-stamina-and-strength-curated-list-of-motivational-music/"><u>In 2024, Boost Stamina and Strength  Curated List of Motivational Music</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-capture-and-compress-swift-iphone-time-lapse-tactics/"><u>[Updated] Capture and Compress  Swift iPhone Time-Lapse Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/safest-and-cutest-toy-drones-for-children/"><u>Safest and Cutest Toy Drones for Children</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/masterful-80s-filters-and-transitions-for-editors/"><u>Masterful 80S Filters & Transitions for Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/optimize-your-memory-perfecting-iphone-album-organization-and-icloud-backup/"><u>Optimize Your Memory  Perfecting iPhone Album Organization and iCloud Backup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/discover-selective-blur-for-dynamic-image-editing/"><u>Discover Selective Blur for Dynamic Image Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/unleashing-iphones-customization-altering-ringtone-sounds/"><u>Unleashing iPhone's Customization  Altering Ringtone Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/updated-best-12-sports-streaming-sites-free-and-paid-for-2024/"><u>Updated Best 12 Sports Streaming Sites (Free & Paid) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-resetting-final-cut-pro-x-the-ultimate-troubleshooting-solution-for-2024/"><u>Updated Resetting Final Cut Pro X The Ultimate Troubleshooting Solution for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-the-best-audio-converter-for-your-needs-top-12-picks/"><u>Updated In 2024, Discover the Best Audio Converter for Your Needs Top 12 Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-the-secrets-of-swelling-youtube-supporters/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking the Secrets of Swelling YouTube Supporters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-sprout-pro-in-depth-review-of-desktop-capturing-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Sprout Pro  In-Depth Review of Desktop Capturing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-transform-tiktok-videos-with-our-select-best-font-tools-for-the-year-23/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Transform TikTok Videos with Our Select Best Font Tools for the Year '23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-solutions-for-vivo-y27s-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Solutions For Vivo Y27s Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/achieve-peak-performance-with-win11-and-zoom-integration-for-2024/"><u>Achieve Peak Performance with Win11 & Zoom Integration for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-initiate-direct-camera-streaming-with-vlc-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Initiate Direct Camera Streaming with VLC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-best-practices-for-hash-tags-in-fb-marketing-campaigns-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best Practices for Hash Tags in FB Marketing Campaigns for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

If you pick a good one then it can bring magical results and once you fail to choose the right lens, you will suffer with losses for each shot. You will find several professionals that prefer to use only kit lenses with their DSLR cameras but those who need to buy it from market, face a great difficulty in selection. Actually, market is loaded with several designs and every lens is designed to serve different needs. If you are also facing some trouble in selection then you are at right place because the article below will help you to get detailed information about how to choose perfect lens for your 4K camera.</p><h2 id="8-Things-to-Consider-Before-Buying-4K-Camera-Lens"><a href="#8-Things-to-Consider-Before-Buying-4K-Camera-Lens" class="headerlink" title="8 Things to Consider Before Buying 4K Camera Lens"></a>8 Things to Consider Before Buying 4K Camera Lens</h2><h4 id="1-Plan-Your-Budget"><a href="#1-Plan-Your-Budget" class="headerlink" title="1. Plan Your Budget"></a>1. Plan Your Budget</h4><p> How much you want to spend- this makes the biggest difference. Because camera lenses are available in variable price ranges with different features so you need to plan a budget that fits your needs. Market is loaded with cheap, mid range and high end camera lenses so you can easily find one within your budget range. But note that if you spend more, you will naturally ensure better results without making any compromise for quality.</p><h4 id="2-Capacity-Matters-Full-Frame-or-APS-C"><a href="#2-Capacity-Matters-Full-Frame-or-APS-C" class="headerlink" title="2. Capacity Matters: Full Frame or APS-C"></a>2. Capacity Matters: Full Frame or APS-C</h4><p> When we talk about capacity of camera lens then two terms comes into consideration: Whether to go for an APS-C lens or spend on Full Frame design. This selection becomes more confusing for beginners. Both of these fits perfectly to all 4K camera models but the biggest benefit of buying APS-C lens is that it use to be light in weight with its compact size whereas the full frame lenses are large enough; they are going to add little weight to your bag. Not to forget that the full frame lenses are costly option.</p><h4 id="3-Type-of-Lens-that-suits-your-needs"><a href="#3-Type-of-Lens-that-suits-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Lens that suits your needs"></a>3. Type of Lens that suits your needs</h4><p> One important parameter for selection of camera lenses is their focal range; this configuration can make great difference in picture quality. Below are few details about 6 most commonly used lens types:</p><p><strong>Ultra Wide:</strong></p><p> Lenses that have focal length equal to or less than 24mm are known as Ultra wide lenses. They are capable enough to capture larger view from scene but here also you can have two options for selection: fisheye to get curved details and rectilinear to maintain straight lines. Ultra wide lenses fall in the category of professional lenses and they are commonly used to capture interior details, architectures and landscapes. Professionals have tricks to get positive results even from the noise produced by fisheye lenses.</p><p><strong>Wide Angle:</strong></p><p> The focal length range between 24mm to 35mm makes wide angle lenses. The prime as well as zoom lenses, both are designed with wide angle focus and you can also have an option to get variable aperture ranges or choose the fixed one. Wide angle lenses usually create more loses but professionals can maintain artistic quality from this noise too. These lenses can be used to capture buildings, landscapes and allow better focus on large gatherings. Many professionals love to capture portraits with wide angle lenses.</p><p><strong>Standard&#x2F; Normal:</strong></p><p> The standard zoom lenses generally come with a wide focal length range that varies between 35 mm to 70 mm whereas photographers call prime lenses with 50mm focal length as normal ones. It is observed to receive faster maximum aperture setting from normal prime lenses and it assists in low light shooting while maintaining shallow field depth. You will find them useful for capturing documentaries, portraits, landscapes and beautiful views from streets. You will definitely find difference in image characteristics with standard and normal selection.</p><p><strong>Telephoto:</strong></p><p> When focal length value goes up to 70mm then it comes in the category of Telephoto lenses. However, many professionals believe that a lens with 135mm focal length is a true Telephoto lens. If you want to get specific details from distant subjects then telephoto lenses can help you to maintain narrower field of view. It means you will avail scenes with blurred background where specific subjects will have more focus. The best idea is to use them for wildlife photography and you can also use them to capture portraits.</p><p><strong>Superzoom:</strong></p><p> The superzoom lenses offer focal length variations between wide to telephoto so you can find them more useful for variable focal length needs- they can serve you without the trouble of changing lens again and again to maintain different focal length. So, they are better known as do it all lenses that offer slower yet variable maximum aperture range. You will find them more useful for your tours when you really don’t want to make your luggage heavier with multiple lenses.</p><p><strong>Macro:</strong></p><p> These lenses come in the category of special lenses and they ensure reproduction ratios higher than 1:1. This is the best choice for extreme close up type photography as you will get focal length range somewhere between 40 to 200mm. These lenses offer extreme sharpness in details while maintaining very small depth of field for close-up shots. They are perfect choice for portraits or close up photography needs as they offer impressive focal length range with stunning sharpness.</p><h4 id="4-Zoom-or-Prime-Each-has-Unique-Features"><a href="#4-Zoom-or-Prime-Each-has-Unique-Features" class="headerlink" title="4. Zoom or Prime: Each has Unique Features"></a>4. Zoom or Prime: Each has Unique Features</h4><p> When we talk about zoom lenses, they make things convenient by allowing zoom between wide angles to telephoto level; so you need not to use multiple lenses. This can be suitable choice for landscape photography. On the other side, Prime lenses offer wide aperture ranges while ensuring higher image quality. Those who need a lens for their landscape photography needs will definitely find the zoom lenses more useful with an option to shoot with f&#x2F;8, f&#x2F;16 and f&#x2F;11 with trouble free settings but wide aperture applications demand Prime collection.</p><h4 id="5-Weight-and-Size-They-make-a-big-difference"><a href="#5-Weight-and-Size-They-make-a-big-difference" class="headerlink" title="5. Weight and Size: They make a big difference"></a>5. Weight and Size: They make a big difference</h4><p> Indeed, this is an important consideration, especially if you are a regular traveller and do not want to carry heavy luggage. It is always good to pick something with light weight whereas on the other side, size makes you think about filters.

The speed as well as quality of autofocus uses to vary with price range of 4k camera lenses.</p><h4 id="7-Image-Stabilization-Important-consideration-for-Professionals"><a href="#7-Image-Stabilization-Important-consideration-for-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="7. Image Stabilization: Important consideration for Professionals"></a>7. Image Stabilization: Important consideration for Professionals</h4><p> Cameras that offer image stabilization use to have a motor inside lens that helps to compensate for shakes in footage. Many brands call this feature by the name: Vibration reduction. The biggest benefit of having a camera with image stabilizer is that it can maintain great picture details even with low light conditions while working at small aperture ranges or lower ISO settings. Note that, cost of image stabilizer type lenses uses to be more as compared to those without image stabilizer. So you can plan for your budget accordingly, however, this feature is more useful for professional photographers or for those who want to capture scenes on the go.</p><h4 id="8-Whether-to-go-for-big-brands-or-third-Party"><a href="#8-Whether-to-go-for-big-brands-or-third-Party" class="headerlink" title="8. Whether to go for big brands or third Party?"></a>8. Whether to go for big brands or third Party?</h4><p> Some of you may plan to save money by simply buying a third party lens but the best suggestion is to spend on branded lenses or simply the lenses offered by your camera manufacturer.

Note that, the picture quality, auto focus performance and crispness ensured by branded lenses are definitely superior. So, if you are in a condition to spend enough then it is good to order your lens from trusted brands that suit your camera.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> With all above options, photographers have huge freedom to maintain great quality for footage. Each lens design offers its own advantage with variable features so the basic idea for selection is to check your need and budget range.

We know that it is always difficult to generate content that goes viral. Some of the vloggers have an uncanny ability of attracting traffic to their channel; frankly, their content is par excellence.

So if you are thinking of including videos to your blog or hosting your very own vlog; our 10 simple ideas will help you get started.</p><p>Finding your own YouTube niche is very important if you want to attract loyal audiences, and get more subscribers, check this guide to know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Find Your Niche and Style. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><p>Looking for <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >a good video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your vlog? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should be the best video editing software for YouTubers.

These vignettes generally have a theme and therefore you can customize them to match your blog.</p><p>You can design your 5X5 Vignette – like the one below - using the 5X5 Vimeo Channel. This YouTube video shows a girl is playing snooker.</p><h4 id="2-Interview"><a href="#2-Interview" class="headerlink" title="2.Interview"></a>2.Interview</h4><p>With this type of video, both you and your interviewee can benefit from increased viewership and attract links. The video is particularly advantageous in improving your rankings on search engines. Just one caveat; make sure you choose a topic that is relevant to your viewers as well as your interviewee’s audiences.</p><p>Hope you enjoy and learn from the video below where Marie Forleo interviews Rachel Hanfling on how to simplify any message. Like Marie, you can call experts from specific fields and interview them to get their advice on the queries posed by your viewers.</p><h4 id="3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video"><a href="#3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video" class="headerlink" title="3.Teach using a “How to” Video"></a>3.Teach using a “How to” Video</h4><p>Demonstrating, almost anything, using a “How to” video is a great way to teach a process by breaking it into a step-by-step protocol. The video ideally, has close-up shots while the person performs a particular task for his viewers.</p><p>BBC Good Food nails the “how-to” video concept. It has devoted an entire tab for “how-to” tutorials that have a range of videos from buying raw materials – the best meat in the market – to making delicious recipes.</p><h4 id="4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank"><a href="#4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank" class="headerlink" title="4.Shoot a candid video prank"></a>4.Shoot a candid video prank</h4><p>Let’s say today is April fool’s day. You can choose to upload a video prank. All you need is a victim and a camera that shoots all the events candidly. If you are a team that is hosting the blog, you can plot a prank on a fellow crew member. Such a video improves the fun quotient as well as entertains your audience. Let your viewers enjoy a good laugh.</p><p>Check out these adorable kids as they perform a video prank – Just for laughs!</p><h4 id="5-Tutor-with-the-screencast"><a href="#5-Tutor-with-the-screencast" class="headerlink" title="5.Tutor with the screencast"></a>5.Tutor with the screencast</h4><p>You can also upload a modified version of the “how-to” tutorial called the screencast. Essentially, a screencast projects your computer screen in the form of a video so that you can train your audience to acquire a particular skill – for example you may teach people how to edit photos using Photoshop.</p><p>In the following video, Tyler Moore demonstrates ‘how to start your own blog’ by performing the exercise on screen.</p><h4 id="6-Shoot-a-documentary"><a href="#6-Shoot-a-documentary" class="headerlink" title="6.Shoot a documentary"></a>6.Shoot a documentary</h4><p>Shooting a documentary is perhaps the best option for a travel blog or a foodie, road trip. Your viewer can actually picture the culture, food, people and terrain; thus, get a feel of a new destination.</p><p>So you think this type of video is suitable for your blog; watch the following video that features the travel vlogger himself - Brain Cox. He has traveled across 30 countries and enjoys shooting videos of his experiences as he travels the world.</p><h4 id="7-Upload-rare-events"><a href="#7-Upload-rare-events" class="headerlink" title="7.Upload rare events"></a>7.Upload rare events</h4><p>Video coverage of rare natural events can be posted if you have a handy camera at that moment. For example, if your blog funds a charity that supports people affected by a disaster; you can post videos to show the intensity of damage caused so that philanthropists understand the need of the hour and donate.</p><p>For example, the video below shows clips that film an approaching tsunami. National geographic has benefited from these videos because someone was fortunate enough to have a camera while it struck, thought of recording it and lived to tell the tale.</p><h4 id="8-Just-Talk"><a href="#8-Just-Talk" class="headerlink" title="8.Just Talk"></a>8.Just Talk</h4><p>This is by far the most common type of video that bloggers upload. You just need your webcam, the time and a topic that you have insights about. This type of vlog is jokingly referred to as the “video rant” – the blogger appears to vent out his frustrations while delivering his insights on the subject.</p><p>Here’s an example of this kind of video. Charles Reeves gained popularity for his blog “Father Apprentice”, where he shares his experiences with new dads so they can enjoy parenthood to the fullest. Check this video, to watch him cater advice to his viewers as he drives.</p><h4 id="9-Cover-an-event"><a href="#9-Cover-an-event" class="headerlink" title="9.Cover an event"></a>9.Cover an event</h4><p>If an event that is happening is relevant to your blog, you can capture it live and upload it for your audience, so they can watch it from the comfort of their home - at their convenience. This blog posts videos of Bill Murray caught on camera. Watch him performing karaoke at Murray Bros Caddyshack restaurant in Florida in the video below.</p><h4 id="10-Create-a-karaoke-video"><a href="#10-Create-a-karaoke-video" class="headerlink" title="10.Create a karaoke video"></a>10.Create a karaoke video</h4><p>YouTube has a huge list of free karaoke videos for their audience. Likewise, you can create karaoke videos of bestsellers and group them according to different genres. This lets you ranks higher among search engines, because people searching for the songs may land on your website. Also, it will let your viewer’s browse from the list, call friends over and party!</p><p>Here’s an example of a karaoke video published on the Dailymotion website.</p><p>Now, you have it - 10 simple video ideas. Happy vlogging!</p><p>Did you like our ideas? Did they work for your blog? If so, we would love to hear your experience.</p><p>Also, if you are still thinking whether to upload those videos, let us know which do you think is the best idea that will click for your blog and why.

In case you want to get audio or music for background from other sources than a built-in library of Filmora, you should import the audio file as well. It will allow you to add media files to the Filmora library and provide easy access for quick edits. For all these things, you can see the IMPORT option in the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"                      alt="Import Audio &amp; Video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Separate Audio Tracks</p><p>In some cases, you may find an existing audio or music track in the video. This particular track may spoil the complete video and create multiple problems. Here, it will be a nice decision to separate the video from the existing audio. It can be possible by using the DETACH AUDIO TRACK features. After detaching the audio, you can also edit that particular one, such as – modifying, altering, or removing. For saving time and avoid multiple menu interactions, you can proceed by using the shortcut command. It is – Ctrl+Alt+D.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/detach-audio-1.png"                      alt="Detach Audio From Video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Audio Keyframing</p><p>If you don’t find the audio or sound effect properly suitable for your video, you should proceed with editing features. You will get a complete audio editor with multiple functionalities and features. Here, you can perform complete audio keyframing activities that will allow you to get a smooth and desired audio file for increasing the video’s effectiveness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-audio-fade-in-fade-out.jpg"                      alt="Audio Keyframing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add Sound Effects</p><p>After completing all types of editing practices and functions completing with audio files, you can start adding them to the video. Here, you can proceed with drag and drop features for merging and adjusting audio files according to the video play duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/audio-effects-1.png"                      alt="Add sound effects"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Export</p><p>Now, your video is complete and ready to share. Before saving the changes and exporting the result, you should run proper testing that will allow you to preview the changes and figure out it is created as you wanted or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-05.png"                      alt="Export"                ></p><p>It is a simple process that you should follow while using Filmora for editing a video and adding audio.
